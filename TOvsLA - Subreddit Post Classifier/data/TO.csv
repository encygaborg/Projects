SamsonFox,0,False,False,False,t3_9tmcid,18,/r/toronto/comments/9tmcid/til_that_one_of_the_biggest_scammers_in_toronto/," Today I came upon a very interesting fact.

 Back in the days of gang busts after Jane Kreba killing, Curlew Moulton was [one of the biggest drug dealers in Toronto](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/torontos-new-murder-capital/article4327089/). Even though [he arrived from Jamaica with multiple gunshot wounds](http://pillsbottlesneedles.blogspot.com/2009/05/curlew-devon-moulton-35-aka-skellion.html), he was let go - until a [drug bust a short time later sealed his fate](https://www.toronto.com/news-story/1817-drug-probe-leads-to-two-arrests/).

 The interesting part is, though, is the [details of this drug bust](https://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2013/2013onsc2450/2013onsc2450.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAHTW91bHRvbgAAAAAB&amp;resultIndex=1).

 Apparently, Moulton was scammed by Arash Missaghi, the perpetrator of one of the biggest [real estate scams](https://torontolife.com/city/crime/bridle-path-mansion-missing-millions-investigation-blew-open-massive-mortgage-scam/) in Toronto area. Being the guy with deep pockets, Mouton actually filed a lawsuit against Missaghi and could likely win.

 Enter Romin Betnovin - a guy who never seemingly dealt drugs. He was *also* scammed by Missaghi, but for some reason decided to switch sides. Interestingly, he asks Mouton, a drug dealer, to sell him heroin to fund his lawyer. Mouton, who normally doesn't deal with heroin, agreed - but Betnovin turned out to be a police informant, and the whole operation was a setup.

 One thing I can tell is that Missaghi seemingly had some very big balls to be able to pull this off. The whole situation is even more interesting giving allegations that Missaghi had an inside man within police, and given that Missaghi continued his scams for nearly a decade after this.",toronto,"TIL that one of the biggest scammers in Toronto, Ara Missaghi, managed not only scam one of the biggest drug dealers in Toronto, Curlew Moulton, but also set him up for arrest for drug dealing when he tried to sue him",197

I have also noticed school ratings and census data being shown next to the listings. Nothing new but convenient.

Seeing a ranking for homeless shelters and another for nearby affordable housing gave me pause. Oh course you can select for that now. Makes sense but seems icky none-the-less. It made me think of Bill Bishop's 2009 book The Great Sort about the polarization in American socio/demographics. Coming soon to Canada I suppose.

One such service is Leslieville-brokerage Realosophy's homefinder. It offers homeless, immigrant, ethnic, and religious  data for each of its listings. [Example](https://www.realosophy.com/HomeSpotter/Listing/W4292338/Toronto/Roncesvalles/383%20Sorauren%20Ave).

joshuakloke,0,False,False,False,t3_9t8jwh,54,/r/toronto/comments/9t8jwh/joshua_kloke_toronto_fc_reporter_the_athletic_and/,"Hi all-

Joshua Kloke from The Athletic here. I've covered Toronto FC since 2015 and my second book, Come on You Reds, a history of Toronto FC, was published in October by Dundurn Press. I also write features on the Maple Leafs and Canadian soccer as well.

I've been in journalism since 2008, when Time Out Istanbul published my review of The National's December gig there. The magazine misspelled my name, but Joshua Klole was undeterred. I've since contributed to ESPN, The Guardian, Sportsnet, Vice Sports The Toronto Star and many more publications.

Since landing at The Athletic, I've tried to tell stories about Toronto FC in a unique and inventive manner. I'm one of the handful of reporters who spend their time with the team at the training ground to bring readers access to the Reds. I love utilizing underlying numbers to help predict where the team is headed and understand what led them to where they are. To be sure, the 2018 season was one of the most disappointing, but incredibly interesting, in club history. How did they get here? What went wrong, and how do TFC right the ship? I'm hoping to answer some of these questions, and more, during this AMA.",toronto,"Joshua Kloke: Toronto FC reporter, The Athletic, and author of Come on You Reds: The Story of Toronto FC",31

905erthrowaway,0,False,False,False,t3_9td05g,46,/r/toronto/comments/9td05g/question_about_opinions_on_the_suburbs_905/,"I recently moved to Toronto, was born in Toronto, family is all from here, but was raised in the outskirts of the GTA, small town. I graduated highschool from the TDSB, but have spent the majority of my life in a smaller town. But the GTA is home to me, I barely feel like I've moved.

Most people in Toronto are pretty cool, but sometimes when people ask where I'm from and I say where they act like I'm from the complete boondocks who must be a complete hick. Not everyone does this but a lot of Torontonians seem to do this, even ones that weren't born here but have been in the city. Especially if I say it's in the Toronto area. It's literally 25 minutes to the border of Toronto from where I'm from, I grew up on the banks of the Humber river, but they'll be like ""you're not from the GTA"". These people seem to think that Toronto and Sauga = the GTA, and that the rest of us are up in Nunavut.

I've been told ""the city is going to chew me up"". I also sometimes here people slam on the suburbs, like complaints about us coming down for events and bars or being racist ….etc.

I'm just wondering where this attitude comes from. It seems only prevalent in downtown Toronto. My whole life has been in the GTA, nothing is ""new"" to me, I've watched Toronto grow and the GTA grow as I've grown. But I'm treated like an outsider / idiot sometimes.

It's just weird, someone from Vaughan, Markham or Mississauga wouldn't react the same way as someone from Toronto, they'd behave like I'm ""one of them"".

I sort of look at the GTA as an entire region and that we are all from the same place, but for some reason the odd downtowners acts like anything outside of downtown is foreign and not part of the area. It's just confusing to me? I never feel out of place in Markham even though I've never lived there, it's just another part of the concrete, hell even Hamilton feels similar. Why do downtowners seem to think they're on an isolated island?

Just because I moved from a small town to a more populated part of the GTA doesn't mean I'm out of my element, I've seen homeless people before and immigrants exist outside of downtown, we aren't racist morons.

Literally the only difference is you see more gay people and more people in general. Again this is only like 10% of people I meet that sort of stick their nose up. Where does this come from?

Thank you two so much. Sometimes suffering can feel invisible, but your compassion speaks volumes. One even offered a hug and it just felt very reassuring. It feels me with gratitude and appreciation for so many sweet and thoughtful souls in this city. I was overwhelmed and couldn't thank you enough in person, but so I felt compelled to at least post on Reddit hoping you may see it.

viaWLL,0,False,False,False,t3_9so8wn,85,/r/toronto/comments/9so8wn/is_it_just_me_or_are_toronto_pedestrians_really/,"I'm a pedestrian and have been commuting via public transit into Toronto for about 5 years now, 2 years in downtown Toronto and 3 years in midtown (Yonge/st Clair). I lived in many different cities in Asia (Japan, Singapore, Malaysia) and the US (Chicago) and Toronto is much worst then any of those I've been in so far. I narrowed it down to the 3 things below that I've personally seen repeatedly

 * People exiting union will cut across front street into the hotel (Fairmount?). There is no street light or crossing marking but people will still cross there and will block traffic for several mins. For some weird reason cars are not honking and will let pedestrians cross even through cars have the right of way. [Google Map](https://www.google.ca/maps/@43.6454865,-79.3814914,3a,60y,67.7h,84.93t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-SFaNJeNPalWByjcjMn0gw!2e0!7i16384!8i8192)  

* Pedestrians will start crossing when the numbers/flashing hands shows. This is the equivalent of a yellow light for cars but people still cross regardless. Sometimes you will see people sprint as the numbers are in the single digits! People who are crossing during a flashing/countdown will go at a regular speed even though they are holding up traffic as this time is meant for cars to clear intersections. Often only 1 or 2 cars will be able to make a right turn even though several would have been able to pass.  

* When a car is partly on a crosswalk, people will stream in front and behind of the car and locks the car in place. And I've seen people give dirty looks or even slam their hands on the hood or the trunk. I've once seen a truck with a bed hitch with some sort of construction vehicle on it. People were streaming in front of the truck and stepping between the truck and the hitch. If the driver were to move people would have been crushed if they were between the hitch and the truck because you wouldn't expect someone would walk between that [Quick google image search](https://vans.honestjohn.co.uk/media/12786268/1_530x353.jpg)  

* This might not be Toronto specific, but I've seen people staring at the phones while at an intersection. They must be watching through their peripherals because when someone besides them acts like they are going to cross they will cross while still looking down. There was almost an accident because of this and now I stand perfectly still when the cross light is red so anyone who is looking at their phone doesn't mistake my body language and cross.

A restaurant to play board games? Why would you go out and do that when you can from the comfort of your own home? I was a cynic...until yesterday.

My best friend invited me out last night for coffee, and either a movie at the Yonge and Eglinton cinemaplex or Snakes and Lattes - so we went there.

Holy crap, was it FUN! It was great to see so many people in the spirit of things. I saw people playing kids games like Guess Who, a group playing some fun game with headbands and cards, and a number of people playing what I could only assume was Yu Gi Oh or Magic The Gathering.

The staff were wonderful, the food was great, and I really enjoyed the environment. At some point toward the end of the evening, we were playing Snakes and Ladders (a game i haven't played in nearly 40 years) and when I landed on a snake, she started clapping, which, in turn, lead to the entire two sections to our right clapping and laughing. It was a great experience, and one I'm sure to remember.

I won two out of three matches.

But S&amp;L won my heart and I will be back there soon.

My only disappointment is that they staff were wearing amazing shirts, which aren't for sale...but thats minor in the grand scheme of things.

Next time I go, I want to find a group to play Cards Against Humanity, that could prove to be amazing fun.

TL;DR: I thought Snakes and Lattes was a lame concept, but I'm converted after an amazing visit to their Yonge and Eglinton location on Friday night.",toronto,My apologies to Snakes and Lattes: I was wrong.,699

Having grabbed the 88 bus south I expected to meet the Lakeshore East train when I got to the Oshawa GO station as they line up the buses and trains to easily transfer without much wait.

The bus gets to the station, I tap off the bus, tap on to the train, and as I'm walking to the train the doors close.  Weird, that's never happened before. I push the button to open the door and nothing. The train seems to start and then stop again, so I think good I got someone's attention. 

The door doesn't open and a couple people inside try to hit buttons inside to no avail. I start knocking on the door and even tried 2 others doors. Nothing again.

After a minute or so of me knocking and no doors opening the train takes off leaving me, my dog, my partner, and a handful of other passengers from the bus stranded here for another hour, ultimately delaying my arrival home until midnight.

I'm a little ticked off to say the least as the train has always given me adequate time to transfer.

Anyone else have this kind of experience with GO? Up until now I've had no issues doing this trip on many different occasions. ",toronto,Stuck at Oshawa Go Station because of inadequate transfer time,0

They host weekly events where people can come to the place and meet other strangers, whilst discussing topics they genuinely care about. They will be given cards/activities that encourage  people to ask ""big talk"" questions, such as: ""What makes you happiest?"" or ""What is something you've always regretted?"".

Unfortunately, they are only organized  in America right now.

That's why I want to plan something similar in downtown Toronto! I'm passionate about human connection, and I just want to create a safe, comfortable space where people can meet one another and feel connected, especially in this fast-paced city.

Another thing I'm inspired by is the Eye Contact Experiment. It's an annual event where strangers come together, sit down, and share a 60 second eye-contact with someone else. I haven't been to one yet, but the idea of it is really beautiful.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you guys think? Will you be interested in something like this? Also, I'd really appreciate if there are like-minded folks who can help me make this into reality!

Driving downtown in slight rain I was making a left. No cars were coming, visibility was slightly low. 

A guy dressed in all black, black bike was coming the opposite way. I didn't see him at first, but half way though my turn I saw him and slammed on my breaks. I was starting from a stop so it wasn't too abrupt. I was still in the opposing middle lane with 1 more lane for him. The guy was already through the intersection and also stopped. I mouthed ""sorry"". 

The guy gave me the finger and told me I was an idiot. So the ""idiot"" in me gave the guy a finger back and that was that I thought.

Nope.  Bike rage was about to commence. 

So I continued down an alley to make my journey to my end distention. At the end of the alley (the guy must have seen me go through) zoomed around the block to cut me off at the other end.

He kind of T intersected me to block me from continuing. Now, my wife is pregnant and we're in an alley with a guy with a super crazed look on his face.  Imagine my fear. He then unblocked me so I start to drive slowly past him. He then gives my window a POW with either his fist or his foot I couldn't tell and yells for me to get out of my car. 

I gun it fearing for our safety. 

I drive down another one way street only to be blocked by a cab who won't get out of the middle of the road. I see him roaring up from behind us and didn't know what to do. I just waited and hoped for the best (lots of witnesses around (3 cars were blocked also by the cab). 

He catches up and starts LAUGHING with a joker style laugh that I'm behind some other cars and can't move. He says ""HAHAHA I bet you wish you were somewhere else now"" or some such thing. Then he tells me to ""watch out who I give the finger to. "" I couldn't agree more. This guy was obviously nuts as he just told me so. It was a good warning. 

He then just bikes off laughing.

I've been fully accident free and never had a speeding ticket in 25 years. I'm usually a super calm driver. I can't remember when I flipped someone off in my car before. This time I totally regretted it. 
 
So that was it. No fight, thank god. No missing teeth or blood. But WTF, why would you chase someone down like that even if it was just over a finger. 

I know I'm going to get roasted now. I just needed to rant and ""guy"" if you're on here. SORRY, I truly am. Please next time just let these things go. I will do the same and never flip the bird to a stranger. ",toronto,Bike Road Rage Rant,16

Only Etobicoke managed to elect councillors with similar ideology to Doug Ford. (Stephen Holyday, Mark Grimes, and Michael Ford)

And some of Ford's big allies lost as well, including Mammoliti and Kelly (who was a deputy mayor when Rob was a mayor)

Of course most of the progressive candidates re-elected again (Matlow, Cressy, Wong-Tam, Perks, Layton, etc.)

Like this article, if Ford's purpose was to make Toronto City council more right-leaning. I think it failed. 

However, the biggest blow for Dog Ford is that his enemy Patrick Brown won the mayoral election in Brampton. Ford, of course cancelled municipal chair election in Peel and York in order to keep Patrick Brown out of the job.

A very important message about my endorsements for the 2018 municipal election:

I need to share an update about my endorsements for the 2018 municipal election, specifically about mayoral candidate Saron Gebresellassi.

On Wednesday October 19, I learned that Saron’s campaign has accepted material support from mayor John Tory’s campaign. I got this information directly from Saron during a phone call. I’d like to briefly explain what this means for me, and why I’m sharing it publicly.

For obvious reasons, many of us feel cynical about elections. We are tired of candidates who compromise on their principles in order to win, who mislead our communities, who fail to be transparent, and who say one thing to their supporters but do another.

Every so often, a candidate with real integrity comes forward and fills us with hope.

During this campaign, Saron has distinguished herself as a talented, outspoken, and courageous candidate. She has repeatedly shown an ability to challenge the old political guard and offer real solutions, especially for the underdogs of our city. Many people have supported Saron’s campaign based on a belief that she is the rare kind of candidate who puts community first, and is always willing to be transparent with us.

For a while, I too believed this about Saron. However, the information Saron shared with me about her dealings with mayor Tory has damaged my feelings about her campaign, and about her claim of loyalty to people before power.

A few weeks ago, Global News hosted the campaign’s first televised mayoral debate, which Saron participated in. Global has now reported that the day before its debate, a Global producer unexpectedly received a text message from Saron. The text message read:

“Sounds great. Toronto will love this. Good move on Tory's part to have me bring in plot twists.”

According to Global, Saron immediately followed up this message with another text saying “wrong recipient, see you tomorrow.”

Global then had a reporter contact Saron to ask about any dealings she may have with mayor Tory’s campaign. At that time, Saron confirmed to Global she had been in communication with mayor Tory’s campaign before the first televised debate. However, Saron said the message she’d accidentally sent the Global producer was innocent, a joke meant for someone close to her. This past Tuesday, October 16, Global publicized Saron’s text messages and her admission that she has been in contact with mayor Tory’s campaign.

To my knowledge, Saron has still not offered any public explanation in response.

When I heard the Global reporting, I contacted Saron personally to ask about it. I did this for two reasons. First of all, I went with Saron to city hall on the day she registered to run for mayor. I was among the first people to publicize her campaign, to express my support, and to encourage others to follow her. Based on all this I felt I needed to know the truth. But my larger concern was that if Global’s reporting was true, Saron owed the community an immediate and full explanation, and had so far failed to provide that explanation.

When I spoke with Saron, she confirmed that everything Global had reported was true, that she has indeed been in contact with mayor Tory’s campaign.

When I asked about the nature of their communications, Saron told me that Tory’s team offered with her a list of contacts for the organizers of mayoral debates. Saron said she understood this offer as an opportunity to gain greater access to the debates, and added that she believed anyone would accept such an offer. Saron told me her team accepted mayor Tory’s list.

I’ve contacted several other mayoral candidates to ask if mayor Tory has made them a similar offer—everyone I asked said no.

Again, to the best of my knowledge, Saron has yet to explain why she privately accepted this support, not just from any candidate, but from the incumbent mayor whose ethics and integrity she has repeatedly questioned during this election.

I did not want to be the one to share this news. I told Saron that her continued silence was a failure of accountability to her community. However, her campaign has remained silent. I’ve decided to come forward out of fear Saron would continue to keep her actions from the community.

I know that this news may not trouble everyone the way it troubles me. However, as someone who has publicly supported and promoted Saron, it wouldn't sit right with me unless I spoke out about this.

I know that my saying this will upset many of you—it upsets me too.

I also recognize that candidates like Saron are already facing an uphill battle, and the last thing I want is to make that struggle harder. But I spoke out in support of Saron on the first day of the campaign, because I believed that was the right thing to do. In the same way, I think that speaking out now is the right thing to do.

I do not believe any candidate for political office can help deliver the changes we all need by making secret compromises with the same powerful people who are oppressing us.

Some people have different feelings—they believe it is often necessary to compromise with power, even without telling the community, as long as your intentions are good. In my experience, making compromises with our political opponents can sometimes help boost one person, or one campaign, or one idea, for a time. But I see no greater benefit for the community that is intentionally being kept in the dark.

Most of all, I see such behaviour as a fundamental failure to tell people in community what you’re doing, and why you’re doing it. Once a political leader has decided to do things in our name without informing us, they have violated our trust and our right to informed representation.

For this reason, I can no longer support or endorse Saron’s campaign to be Toronto’s mayor. I will not be endorsing any mayoral candidate this year.

We are two days away from the 2018 election. I have not voted yet but I intend to. I hope everyone who reads this and is eligible to vote will do so. I also hope we can continue to have difficult but necessary conversations about the trust, transparency, and accountability we are all seeking in these tough political times. I know it may be hard to understand why I have chosen to speak up, but I hope you do. Thanks for reading.

From young newcomers in their fancy cars to middle aged people as well, all take pride in speeding their cars and making it their mini highway. I do see speedometers/radars installed notifying them on their speed but I have yet to come across speed cams in “most” parts of the city. 

What is holding back the government to install speed cams? Is it privacy issues, infrastructure costs, just don’t see the need? I’m curious to know. 

I feel the city is losing out on HUGE revenue and it’ll only get worse as we keep seeing newcomers who are used to shamelessly honking for no reason, jumping traffic lights and speeding on roads - I see it everyday.

&amp;nbsp;

Hello good people of Reddit,

&amp;nbsp;

My name is [Andrew Massey](https://www.facebook.com/MasseyTO/) and I'm pretty stoked to be doing my very own AMA! I'm also a named candidate in the 2018 Toronto Municipal Election and running to be City Councillor for the downtown core; [Ward 10 - Spadina-Fort York](https://www.toronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/9544-2018_Polling_Ward_10.pdf).

&amp;nbsp;

**A little bit about myself:** I'm 30 years old, I rent an apartment downtown, and I work for a non-profit government organization. I grew up in small towns, moved here for school in 2008, lived abroad for a while after that, and returned to Toronto a few years ago in search of jobs. Really, I'm just this guy, you know?

&amp;nbsp;

In July, under our previous 47-Ward configuration, I made a Reddit-inspired decision to enter the political arena as a democratic competitor. This was so that [the incumbent](https://i.imgur.com/x4MU0XQ.jpg) would not be acclaimed to the position (and to the $112k salary). Welp, as it turned out, [our power-hungry premier](https://i.imgur.com/dysaFLR.jpg) wasn't a big fan of the incumbents either. #ThanksDoFo.

&amp;nbsp;

Now, with only 25 Wards, the game has completely changed. This is most evident in downtown, where there are very obviously far too many constituents for any one Councillor to manage. I've met and talked with my competitors, and literally *every single candidate* in Ward 10 is punching above their weight. Whoever wins this election will face very stormy waters for the next four years and no one is well-equipped to weather that storm. Anyone claiming otherwise is either deluded, or a charlatan.

&amp;nbsp;

I've stayed in the race with a two-part mission:


**1)** I hope to offer low and middle income voters a more relatable voice on Toronto's City Council. 

**2)** As a candidate, I want to demonstrate to younger voters that getting involved in politics is not a hard thing to do. You just have to care about where you live.

&amp;nbsp;

There is no shortage of critical issues facing Toronto, but it should go without saying that poverty reduction is the one issue that *must* be made a priority.


Poverty itself is an issue that spans generations and housing affordability is at its core. I truly believe that making it easier for young people to rent downtown will have a positive ripple effect throughout the city for years to come. Therefore, if elected, **I will use every opportunity to fight for strict rent increase control and expedited community housing developments**.

&amp;nbsp;

So, with all that said, please join me today to discuss getting involved in politics, my take on the other candidates, or whatever else comes to mind. Ask Me Anything.

&gt;*Toronto, our city of neighbourhoods, is splintering apart. Can we find a way to include everyone as our neighbourhoods change? Will we protect libraries, community programs, and childcare as places our community needs? Where do arts and culture, nature and green spaces, housing and development fit in our community? These answers aren’t coming from political insiders. If we want solutions, we need different voices to represent us all. So I am leaning in. I sincerely believe we are a community that cares. I saw it as I raised my kids here in our East-End neighbourhood. I saw it as I worked in community and for it. From bedbug funding to vacant stores and Pop-Up shops to school hubs, I have created change. I envision a community where everyone belongs.*

Hi. I am Diane Dyson. I want to represent ward 19 as a city councillor and I am here to host an AMA.

We expect politicians to act with purpose and integrity. My work is informed by a genuine belief in providing opportunities for people to thrive together. I am an active community member and respected expert on ideas of neighbourhoods and belonging. Public service is not just a profession for me but a lifelong passion. I am stepping into the field of politics because of my strong commitment to the value of equity and my focus on stronger, inclusive communities.

I am a social researcher, activist, and blogger. For the past two decades I have worked on issues addressing neighbourhoods, schooling, and poverty. I am currently on leave as Director, Research &amp; Public Policy at WoodGreen Community Services, a large neighbourhood-based multi-service agency in East End Toronto. As a single mother who benefited from a childcare subsidy and other public services, I value strong neighbourhoods and inclusion.

While at WoodGreen, I focused on issues that helped communities thrive. I led research and program development on access to employment, community services, housing programs, settlement and integration, and community economic development. I also was a core member of Community Assets for Everyone, successfully putting community hubs on the provincial government's agenda. I was the policy lead and supervisor for the DECA/WoodGreen Pop-Up Shop project which successfully pushed for the elimination of the vacant storefront tax rebate.

At the municipal level, I have successfully pushed for fairer taxes , the poverty reduction strategy, community hubs, tenant rights, and funding for vulnerable people facing bed bugs. I am well-traveled in the City Hall's corridors, sitting on numerous municipal committees including at the Toronto Newcomer Leadership Table, Wellbeing Toronto, Urban Heart, Poverty Reduction Advisory Committee, Children’s Wellbeing, Child and Youth Action Committee and, most recently, the Seniors Strategy Accountability Table.

The Raptors start a new era — without DeMar DeRozan, and with a new superstar, Kawhi Leonard. The move, which has broken the hearts of some Toronto fans is also one that the team and many say will bring the Raptors a championship.

On Thurs. Oct. 18, after game one against the Cleveland Cavaliers, Doug Smith will be answering you questions from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. on everything about the Raptors, the NBA, and anything else that might come to mind.

**Here's a quick bio from the man himself:**

As long as there have been Toronto Raptors, I’ve been covering the Toronto Raptors in some way, shape or form which either means I’m good at holding a job or I’m one of the world’s foremost experts on bad basketball. Born and raised in Niagara Falls – the true centre of the universe – and cut my basketball teeth on the Buffalo Braves. I’ve been at The Star for more than two decades and included in that stint are eight Olympic Games and four years as president of the Professional Basketball Writers Association for something to do. Oh yeah, I like stools and baseball, too.

**Doug Smith takes:**

Why did DeMar DeRozan's trade impact Toronto so much? [Here's](https://www.thestar.com/sports/doug_smiths_sports_blog/2018/07/19/why-did-demar-derozans-departure-hit-such-a-nerve--he-was-like-u.html) what Doug had to say about that.

[Doug and DeMar](https://i.redd.it/2gvvev8hzqs11.jpg)

Here's a look into why Doug Smith believes that [Kawhi Leonard is one of the top five players in the NBA](https://www.thestar.com/sports/raptors/2018/10/17/why-is-kawhi-leonard-one-of-the-top-five-players-in-the-nba.html)

[Look at that wingspan!](https://i.redd.it/284ev3220rs11.png)

&amp;#x200B;

Finally, are the Raptors ready for the championship? Keep up with [Doug Smith's sports blog](https://www.thestar.com/sports/doug_smiths_sports_blog.html) — for the most up-to-date analysis from the guy who has seen the evolution of the Raptors for 23 years.

sofiavisitor,0,1539791604.0,False,False,t3_9osii2,54,/r/toronto/comments/9osii2/primer_on_our_new_criminal_cannabis_laws/,"This is an abbreviated review of [Bill C-45 aka The Cannabis Act](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-45/royal-assent). This isn't legal advice. And some rules have exceptions. I haven't seen all this information in one place, and I've seen some misinformation out there, so I hope this helps anyone who is interested. The Cannabis Act is the *Federal* law, but cannabis is not regulated the same in each province: Ontario (and municipalities) can *tighten* these requirements but *cannot* impose *criminal* penalties for breaking their tighter penalties. 


**Our new laws**

1. If you are 18 or over you can't have more than 30 grams in a public place
1. If you are under 18 you can’t have have more than 5 grams anywhere
1. You can't distribute, or have for the purposes of distributing, more than 30 grams (distributing includes transporting; distributing doesn’t just mean you distribute or sell it to other people)
1. Can't give cannabis to someone under 18 unless you take reasonable steps to ascertain the individual’s age
1. Can't possess cannabis with the intent to sell (without a license to sell)
1. Can't import or export cannabis or possess for the purpose to export
1. ~~Can't use organic solvents (such as butane, propane) to alter cannabis~~
1. Can't have or distribute anything intended to be used to make or distribute cannabis in a way that breaks laws
1. Can't knowingly have or distribute cannabis sold/produced/distributed contrary to law (that any law was broken for it to be made, sold, or transported)
1. Can't have any budding/flowering plants in public
1. Can't have more than 4 plants in a dwelling (including the land around the dwelling)

**Equivalency – what equals 30 grams**

* dried cannabis = this is what the 30 gram limit refers to
* fresh cannabis = 150 grams is deemed equivalent
* solids containing cannabis = 450 grams is deemed equivalent
* non-solids containing cannabis = 2,100 grams is deemed equivalent
* cannabis solid concentrates = 8 grams is deemed equivalent
* cannabis non-solid concentrates = 8 grams is deemed equivalent
* cannabis plant seeds = 30 seeds is deemed equivalent


**Punishments**

1. Police can choose to give a summons ticket for less than 50 grams (or equivalent) rather than arrest
1. Police can choose to give a summons ticket for five or six plants in a home rather than arrest
1. If you are arrested rather than given a ticket, the government lawyer has the choice to retroactively make the situation as though you were given a ticket
1. If the fine on a summons ticket is paid, you are given absolute discharge and deemed not to have been convicted of the offence
1. If you don’t pay the fine you will receive a conviction
1. You can be jailed if a fine is not paid
1. If you don’t pay the fine, drivers licenses or plates can be not renewed or suspended until a fine is paid

 
**Exemption for medical emergencies**

No punishments (including no violation of pre-trial release, probation order, conditional sentence or parole) for possessing  excess amounts or having sourced illicit cannabis if there is a reasonable belief of a life-threatening reaction to *any* psychoactive drug, where someone sought aid or stayed on scene when responders arrived, *if* that led to the evidence being found.

That is long-winded. Basically you can't be charged. Also, lots of people have things like probation where they have restrictions on their life, such as not being able to have weed. In short, these legal restrictions will not be enforced in the case of life-saving first aid from a drug overdose. So even if you have for instance been let out of jail on a condition you don't have pot on you until your court appearance, that would be ignored.

**Added to existing smoking laws**

Can't smoke or vape in workplace or workplace lobby, stairwell, elevator, cafeteria, washroom or other common area (added to existing smoking laws)

**Rules for stores/producers** (if you were curious, in addition to the federal laws, [here are Alberta's procedures](https://aglc.ca/sites/aglc.ca/files/aglc_files/Cannabis_Retailer_Operational_Manual_FINAL_Sept%2026_1.pdf))

1. Can't sell with use of testimonials, endorsements, images of glamour/daring/vitality, or images of persons/animals/characters
1. Can't promote cannabis or accessories by communicating information about its price or distribution
1. Can't circumvent advertisement rules on radio/tv/internet sites outside of Canada that reach Canada
1. Can't have cannabis brands sponsor events/activity/person/facility
1. Can't have give-aways of products or services or freebies at stores with purchase of cannabis or accessories
1. Can't have minors in cannabis stores (effectively)
1. Can only sell: dried cannabis, cannabis oil, fresh cannabis, non-budding/flowering cannabis plants, and seeds
1. Can't have vending machine or self-serve display
1. Can't sell any cannabis combined with nicotine, caffeine, or alcohol
1. All sales of cannabis are final sale


Edit: *Below here are additions after the post went up*

**Clarifying cannabis and minors**

From the federal, criminal, perspective: yes “but” (I’ll explain the but), a minor can possess cannabis. They can possess 5 grams of dried cannabis, “or equivalent” in other forms. These other forms work out to fresh cannabis (25 grams), solids containing cannabis (75 grams), non-solids containing cannabis (350 grams), cannabis solid concentrates (1.25 grams), cannabis non-solid concentrates (1.25 grams), and cannabis plant seeds (5 seeds).

A minor for this answer is someone who 12 or older but younger than 18. Someone under 12 can’t be charged with a criminal offence in Canada, but there are of course punishments for people using the help of people under the age of 18 to grow/transport/produce cannabis, so it’s not a legal loophole to use a minor.

Minors are not allowed to grow or harvest plants.

The weight limits between adults and minors differs (30 grams vs. 5 grams), but also importantly so does where they can have cannabis. An adult can theoretically have more than 30 grams in a place that is not public: you could have 31 grams in your house. You can’t take those 31 grams out of your house at the same time, but you could have plants that make more than 31 grams and then leave that amount in your house. A minor, however, can’t possess more than 5 grams at any time.

Possession has a legal meaning. It does not mean that you have it on you. It means that, but also if you “have it in any place, for the use or benefit of himself”. Also you can another person can possess something at the same time if it is with your “knowledge and consent”. So if you had 4 grams on you, and you had for example 4 grams at the same time in your friend’s locker at school, you would “possess” 8 grams, and therefore be over the 5 gram limit. The limit is basically the sum of the cannabis that “is yours”, wherever it is. And if you know about someone in your car having more than 5 grams and let them ride in your car, then you, by extension, have possession of more than 5 grams.

A minor, in addition to the limits placed on the amount they possess, can’t “cultivate, propagate, or harvest” cannabis. So there is a zero-plant limit for minors. Also, a minor can’t take a summer job harvesting cannabis, or growing seedlings.

Adults cannot possess “any cannabis that they know is illicit”; you can’t have cannabis on you that you know came from a way that broke the law, such as from 100 plants in one house, from being imported, or from being sold by a person without a license. The law against possessing cannabis that you know “is illicit” does not apply to minors; interpret that as you will, but it greatly reduces the potential charges against someone under 18. 

Adults cannot distribute more than 30 grams. Minors are limited to 5 grams for distribution. “Distribute” includes transporting, or cause to be transported (mailing), and of course also includes selling.

Minors also can’t see cannabis or packaged cannabis on display, or cannabis accessories on display, so this functionally makes cannabis stores over-18 stores. Also to protect minors no one can cannabis products or accessories with an “appearance, shape or other sensory attribute or a function that there are reasonable grounds to believe could be appealing to young persons”.

 
**On plants and growing**

*Four per dwelling*

You can’t control or own, basically, any more than four plants. One, two, three, or four is fine. Five or six plants is criminal but has dramatically less punishment than seven or more. The law restricts you to four plants *that are budding or flowering*. Before you think there is an exemption and you can have 100 seedlings, please note that there is also a separate section of the law that outlaws you cultivating, propagating, harvesting (or offering to do any of these things) of more than four plants in any single dwelling at any single time. So it doesn’t matter if the plants are budding or flowering, you are limited to four, period.

*30 grams at home*

The 30 gram limit is for possession *in public*. You can't have more than 30 grams for the purposes of selling or distributing (even giving away), but in your home there is no simple limit on how much cannabis you have. The 30 grams is for possession in public. So if your plants produce 300 grams, that is fine. As there are also limits on transporting more than 30 grams, public for this purposes would include having it in the trunk of your car or in a backpack, even if you aren't waving it around in public. But the 30 gram limit does not apply to your home. Minors are limited to 5 grams, public, or private, and zero plants.


*What is a dwelling*

The limit on four plants is for your home or dwelling. This can include a mobile home, but it has to be where you “ordinarily reside”. For the normal example of a house or apartment, it includes the structure and the yards, the porch, garden, and any sheds or other structures on the property. The limit is four per dwelling, regardless of there being one adult or ten – it is not four per person.

*Plants in public*

A person cannot have in public any plant that is budding or flowering. You can have a plant that isn’t budding or flowering in public. A person cannot possess or transport more than four plants that are budding or flowering. You are however, in public, subject to the weight restrictions of non-dried cannabis, and also a limit of 30 seeds. I’ll note that the law also separately prohibits cultivating or harvesting cannabis at any place that isn’t your “dwelling house”, so you can’t grow in a rented greenhouse, or run a “bring your plant to me to harvest it” business. 

*Growing exemptions*

Minors are are prohibited from growing, cultivating, harvesting, propagating, or doing anything else relating to growing a cannabis.

A bit niche but the law also outlaws growing anything else other than cannabis plants that produces cannabis. So: no modified plants with them grafted in, or bacteria that makes THC.


**On advertising**

Though the default is no promotion, including giving pricing, there are exceptions to not being able to communicate pricing (and there may be exceptions to these exceptions). Sorry, as I said there are exceptions to many of the rules. The exception to advertising (including pricing) is that if someone a is authorized to produce, sell or distribute cannabis, they can promote (which would include giving prices):

1.  *directly* to individuals (mailer, email) *by name*, or

2. in a place where minors are prohibited (such as a bar), or

3. websites where the advertiser has ""taken reasonable steps to ensure that the promotion cannot be accessed by a young person"" (but the website must be hosted in Canada), or

4. in a cannabis store (of course)

**On mailing cannabis**

The mail may have their own laws but you are limited to transporting 30 grams. This is an area you would want to be careful in as you may be seen, incorrectly or correctly, as selling the cannabis if you are mailing the cannabis. But my read on it is that you could have a total of 30 grams in the mail at any one time which would include up to the point that the person who is receiving the mail takes possession of it. So if you mail four people ten grams each on one day, I would suggest you are now transporting more than 30 grams. But mailing one person 20 grams would appear to be OK, although each province might have its own issues with bringing in cannabis, and also the postal system may have laws prohibiting it. But criminally it would appear not to be criminal. 

This is of course assuming the mail does not cross the Canadian border. (Don't do that.)

On the topic of mailing (and mail-order cannabis), if you *cause* cannabis to be distributed illegally, or if you assist or aid in it being distributed illegally, that is a crime. And selling without a license would be illegal, so the mailed cannabis that was bought would be illegal, so you causing the mailing to happen, sending money for it to be mailed, and taking and possessing the package that was sent from someone without a license to sell would all be offences.

**On being high in public**

This is off the topic of the Cannabis bill but Section 175 of the Criminal Code of Canada prohibits being ""drunk"" in public. Not ""intoxicated"". So, unless you are otherwise causing a disturbance, loitering, or interfering with others, there would be no outright prohibition on being high. Could ""drunk"" end up being interpreted as ""high""? Maybe, but that isn't the law at the moment. Also I'm ignoring operating a vehicle for this answer. A province and/or city may have their own offences about being high in public but it wouldn't be criminal.

**On medical grow permits / ACMPR**

My take is that the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations would not now allow you to have the number you were previously licensed to have - no more - but you're getting ""into the weeds"". I read the Cannabis Act as allowing the Access to Cannabis for Medical Purposes Regulations licenses/client designations to continue, so a limit of X plants would still let you have X plants, but you are not now allowed X+4.

**Driving while impaired**

The Cannabis Act doesn’t suddenly make driving while high a criminal offence: we have new laws about the amount of THC in the blood and also about the testing method(s) for measuring THC. I’m not going to get into that discussion much but I will say that we have had, we do have, and we will continue to have laws prohibiting driving impaired. The Criminal Code prohibits operating a motor vehicle, whether it is in motion or not (this includes sleeping in a car that is turned off), while the person’s ability to operate the vehicle is impaired by alcohol or a drug. If you are impaired, you are liable for a criminal offence. It is that simple. It is not about your personal tolerance. If you refuse a test which a police officer (formally) demands, that is an offence. Please do not drive impaired. Please do not drive after you have smoked or consumed. The nuances of how much THC and the reliability of a saliva test and people’s personal tolerances aren’t the point, just please don’t drive and take the risk.

**Cannabis you already possess**

What a person had before legalization (other than medical cannabis) technically remains illegal, or ""illicit"" as the law defines it, because it was acquired by breaking a law. How that is proved would remain to be seen. Functionally it would be legal in the sense you can possess it; you just can't possess it ""knowing"" it it is illicit, which is going to be hard to prove without you volunteering that information

**Correction regarding organic solvents**

I had written that a person is not allowed to use organic solvents to alter cannabis (this would include isopropyl alcohol, butane, etc.);  this was wrong, but somewhat splitting hairs. I read it that you are allowed to use organic solvents on cannabis which you have obtained legally, as far as the federal government is concerned, though there may be provincial, municipal, zoning, insurance, and who knows what else issues with such a process. But if this a big part of your life, and you are not just using isopropyl alcohol, you might want to get legal advice, since subsection 12(1) and 12(2) have some ambiguity on how they interact. The distinction is made that you can do this on cannabis you have acquired and possess legally, such that the use of solvents would be an additional criminal charge to a person who has an excess number of plants, or has acquired cannabis illegally, and then uses that cannabis to make concentrates using a solvent.",toronto,Primer on our new criminal cannabis laws,87

At first we assumed it was someone's cell phone but quickly discovered it was coming from the elevator speaker. 

The most offensive part was the subject matter. It was talking about the mayoral election process being rigged and asked people to support a certain neo-Nazi piece of shit who isn't worth mentioning by name. It continued until I got out. I went down to the front desk to talk to security about it (property manager had gone home) and he said no one in the building has control over it and the message must have come from the security company itself. While I'm relieved it's not coming from within the building it needs to stop. Assuming this is true, I'm going to let the property manager know about it tomorrow.

I've lived in the city for just over 5 years and, in that time, have been an avid biker and (due to work needs) transitioned into being a more regular driver and it's pretty ridiculous out there.

In the last week alone, I've seen;

1. A biker slam a cars hood, calling the driver an asshole, because the driver hugged the corner when making a right turn (not cutting this guy off at all, as the driver was clearly there way before the biker waiting for traffic to clear). This is the safe way to make this turn, by the way.

2. A lady cuss out a driver for ""almost hitting her"" while she was jaywalking on a blind corner

3. Multiple U-turns, without any signal, by taxis and cars alike.

It's a little ridiculous.

I know it's been a problem for a while but it's no wonder there's so many pedestrian and bike accidents every year. When everyone thinks they have the right of way, things get scary.

Now with the growing popularity of scooter share services in the States like Bird and Limes (and the potential of it coming to Canada) I feel like that will only compound the existing accident and fatality numbers in this city.

There's no reason the streets can't be safer here. People just need to chill out a little bit.

I know it’s pointless to try and enforce such an idea, but does anyone else not see the glaring issue here?

Nobody in Ontario today is smoking legally obtained weed.

That’s pretty fucked up. I can’t even go out today and smoke legal weed, because it’s probably going to be at least Monday until I’d actually get any.

I just find it weird and wondered if anyone else had thought about this in Ontario’s system. 

edit: another thought: how are the government protecting underaged purchases without there being physical stores? Anyone can enter a bullshit date of birth and use a credit card. Some cards can be issued at 16, or 18 - both ages are unable to legally buy weed - but how does the government actually check this? Hell, I’d bet kids can go get a prepaid card from Shoppers and go nuts.

I'm not great with UI/UX, if you have any ideas on how I could make it better I'd appreciate some feedback. 

As for features, I have the following planned:

- Ward overlay
- Geofencing (if something happens in x km radius around you, you'd receive a push notification)
- Google Streetview integration

If you have an idea for a future, let me know. I'd be more than happy to discuss it.

If you want to catch up with this thread later, you can read it here. Thanks again. 

**Update 12:43 pm:** u/Mitchell_Osak is running into some issues with his reddit. u/toronto_star is going to be posting for him. We'll identify the posts where it's him and not me, Irene.

**Update**: Irene here - we're live! Thanks to everyone for being here and the healthy lineup of questions already. Looking forward to this hour with you all.

Hi everyone! **Irene Gentle**, here. I’m Editor of the Toronto Star. 

It seems like we have been talking about this for a long time, but it’s finally happening — pot will officially be legal as of midnight tonight. But legalization is just the start of the conversation, and the questions about new investments, new jobs, new rules and new habits. What it means for Canada is one thing. What about what it means for you, and the issues you care about?

We’re here to help. The Toronto Star is hosting an AMA with three leading industry professionals **Tuesday, Oct. 16 (today) at noon.** Our panel of experts can answer your questions about [the law](https://www.thestar.com/news/cannabis/2018/10/14/policies-on-pot-use-by-police-reveal-lingering-prohibition-mindset-says-professor.html), dispensaries, [health](https://www.thestar.com/news/cannabis/2018/10/02/researchers-look-into-marijuana-treatment-for-nerve-pain-in-men-and-women.html) and more. I, Irene, will be here moderating the discussion through u/toronto_star.

Here are the experts who’ll be around to chat:

**Trina Fraser** ([u/trinafraser](https://www.reddit.com/user/trinafraser)): co-managing partner at Ottawa business law firm Brazeau Seller Law, and head of the firm’s CannaLaw group. Her area of expertise is cannabis law. In addition to acting for licensed producers and (soon-to-be) licensed retailers of cannabis in Canada, Trina advises cannabis industry participants such as clinics, software/application providers, service providers and investors.

**Dr. Melissa Snider-Adler** ([u/melissasnideradler](https://www.reddit.com/user/melissasnideradler)): chief medical review officer for DriverCheck and a Board-certified addiction medicine physician. She teaches residents at Queen’s University’s Family Medicine department about addiction medicine, and also provides expert opinions and assessments of health-care workers who may be struggling with substance use. With the upcoming legalization of cannabis, Melissa has been speaking at conferences and to companies across Canada about the impact of legalization on the workplace.

**Mitchell Osak** ([u/Mitchell\_Osak](https://www.reddit.com/user/Mitchell_Osak)): managing director of Business Consulting at Grant Thornton, one of Canada’s largest advisory and accounting firms. He has extensive experience consulting to the cannabis industry including licensed producers, investors and governments. Mitchell is also a cannabis thought leader, speaking and writing extensively on global cannabis industry trends, regulatory issues and consumer behaviour.

They will be here Tuesday at noon to answer all your cannabis questions.

In meantime, here’s a [basic explainer](https://www.thestar.com/news/cannabis/2018/07/21/as-cannabis-legalization-looms-we-answer-your-burning-questions-about-weed.html) of everything you need to know about legalization and here’s a link to the rest of [our cannabis coverage](https://www.thestar.com/news/cannabis.html).

My doctor is pretty useless for mental health stuff, I'm a transgender (ftm) so he tries to say if I'm anxious or depressed that my testosterone dose needs to be raised when in reality it has nothing to do with that and my levels are fine. I'm wondering whether to call a new dr or go to emergency? I would prefer care sooner than later, but I think I could make it a week or two longer if I had hope.

We have three exciting AMAs lined up for this week!

#####**October 16, Noon: Toronto Star Cannabis Legalisation Experts Panel**

Cannabis will be legal as of Oct. 17 - what does that mean for you? Star Editor-in-Chief Irene Gentle will be moderating the discussion. Here are the experts who'll be here to chat:

**Trina Fraser**: co-managing partner at Ottawa business law firm Brazeau Seller Law, and head of the firm's CannaLaw group. In addition to acting for licensed producers and licensed retailers of cannabis in Canada, Trina advises a multitude of cannabis industry participants.

**Dr. Melissa Snider-Adler**: chief medical review officer for DriverCheck and a Board-certified addiction medicine physician. She teaches residents at Queen's University's Family Medicine department about addiction medicine, and provides expert opinions and assessments of health-care workers who may be struggling with substance use. Melissa has been speaking at conferences and to companies about the impact of legalization on the workplace.

**Mitchell Osak**: managing director of Business Consulting at Grant Thornton, one of Canada's largest advisory and accounting firms. He has extensive experience consulting to the cannabis industry including licensed producers, investors and governments. Mitchell is also a cannabis thought leader, speaking and writing extensively on global cannabis industry trends, regulatory issues and consumer behaviour.

#####**October 18: Doug Smith, Sports Reporter**

Excitement for a second team in Toronto has hit stratospheric levels as the Toronto Raptors have parted with All-time Raptors great and fan favourite DeMar DeRozan, while adding top-5 player Kawhi Leonard. **[Doug Smith](https://twitter.com/SmithRaps)** will be here to talk about all things Raptors.

#####**October 19, Noon: Andrew Massey, Ward 10 Councillor Candidate**

In the interest of democratic competition, **[Andrew Massey](https://www.facebook.com/MasseyTO)** decided to run for Councillor in Toronto's 47-Ward election so that the incumbent would not be acclaimed to the position.

Now, under the 25-Ward configuration, he's stayed in the race with the hope of offering low and middle income voters a more representative and relatable voice on Toronto's City Council.

Join him on Friday at noon to discuss getting involved in local government, his take on the other candidates, and making Toronto a better place to live for renters.",toronto,This Week's AMA Schedule!,13

I noticed several GTA municipalities that have opened up the option for online voting. I think it's incredibly smart, but I can understand the fear behind it.

Ajax has a pin + birthdate verification system. I think it's pretty shitty verification, but because Ajax is so small I imagine there is not much interest to 'scam' the voting system as it would be for Toronto.

How could this work in Toronto? It's bound to be implemented eventually. Perhaps requiring all 'online' voters to have a valid Ontario drivers licence or photo card along with a two step verification through a PIN mailed to you and token that is generated randomly on your smart phone.

Another method I have heard of is developing a 'voting app'. The app only works on the newer smart phones with finger print or face ID verification. Your vote is 'registered' if your finger print or face ID matches. 

I understand the concerns about online voting, but each voting method has their own flaws.",toronto,Municipal Elections and Online Voting,3

Angelo Carnevale: Being endorsed by Pretator (Premier+Dictator) Ford and his secret mistress Kinga Surma (MPP of the riding), has very annoying video all over the facebook, instagram, etc. 
However, I would not support anyone endorsed by Ford.

John Campbell: He is conservative, but he is more central-right like John Tory. I think he’s the most active councillor in the west side to be honest. I think people who are anti-Ford would definitely vote for him. 

Stephen Holyday :Doug Holyday’s son.. and actively Pro-Ford facist councillor. I believe he is much more quiet compared to Giorgio Mammoliti, but I consider Holyday no different from Mammoliti. I would avoid any councillors who are Pro-Ford since Etobicoke need more transit. 

Erica Kelly: She was the NDP candidate of the riding back in the provincial election, and she is the only left wing candidate in this ward (Im assuming) Based on the demographic and recent voting trend.

From a Facebook post:

&gt;PLEASE SHARE THIS POST

&gt;""The crossing guard at Mount Joy Public School was [allegedly] assaulted this morning by an off-duty police officer and then the crossing guard was arrested by York Region Police for mischief, when he was only doing his job. If you have any photos/videos of the altercation, please send them to me.

&gt;[...]The crossing guard is 70 years old and got a heart attack in the police cruiser, after being handcuffed in front of the children/community that respects him. He was taken to Markham Stouffville Hospital and is now recovering"" 

&gt;Safety is a big concern, especially in school area and in Greensborough. We have to do our part to keep it safe!

&gt;UPDATE#1: The crossing guard has been released from hospital. The officer in question is from the Toronto police force. All are under investigation.

&gt;UPDATE#2 I’ve reached out to the family and he is currently recovering and resting. We are still seeking more witnesses or people with video or picture evidences. For those who wants to send good wishes I can pass that message along for you. Let’s do our part and continue to keep our community safe.

&gt;UPDATE#3:

&gt;-The cross guard is doing well and recovering.

&gt;-He passed out and did not have a heart attack.

&gt;-All the witnesses have gave their statements

&gt;-he is no longer charged for mischief as it’s under police investigation
