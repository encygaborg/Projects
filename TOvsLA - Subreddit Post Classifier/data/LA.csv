The three of us (Matthew, Kai, &amp; Fernando) are UCLA alums and from all over LA County, from Northridge to South Gate. Our mission is to solve the problem of why it's absurdly difficult and incredibly boring to learn about, let alone vote in LA. We built an app, a new front page of your city, that funnels in all bits of local info (local news, soapboxes, events, ballot info) and access to representatives and community orgs directly to the voters and residents of LA County. We're trying a whole bunch of new cool civic stuff, like hosting digital town halls (civic AMAs) with reps and orgs– shout out to u/LACBP and Long Beach Mayor Robert Garcia for hosting the first ones. Councilman Paul Koretz is next up for all of you on the Westside!

There simply isn't any follow through after you register to vote. Most young folks register on a college campus or the DMV and then do nothing civic until an election shows up 4 years later. There aren't any easy, quick ways to know what's happening in your district or city IRL, never mind meeting your neighbors or knowing your city council-person's name. A bad recipe for preparing and sustaining voters in our opinion, so we made a delicious one lol. We equip you with all of the in's and out's of your city, and even verify your voter status from the get-go so your reps and neighbors can see that you are a verified voter and hold a lot of power.

We're here today to introduce the 2.0 version of our Ballot Info Tool for the Midterms! Big thank you to many of the early users who joined from the sub and gave us ways to improve the Tool. We don't collect your data to sell it to advertisers or anything like that. We only ask for your info so we can properly place you in your city and display your specific ballot information, and hope to run polls down the line! Ok, enough chit-chat here's how it'll help you vote, and vote prudently:

* Worked with Ballotpedia &amp; Voter's Edge to provide clear, **nonpartisan 1-liners for each YES/NO** for every ballot measure– including all City and County measures in LA County
* After you comb through the ballot, you can **make your votes right then and there** and see what percentage of % of LA agrees with you
* We give you your **polling location** and connect you with **Uber &amp; Lyft** so you can ride-share straight to the polls
* Voters and residents can c**omment and converse with everyone in LA County** about each race and measure, and pool your knowledge. Feel free to drop in your fav resources, articles, and links that add to each ballot item.
* **Share specific props** and races to friends &amp; family in LA and get out the vote!

TL;DR: We built an app, The Burg, for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/the-burg-your-communitys-app/id1324715693?ls=1&amp;mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.burg.mobile) that connects you to the information, people, and reps in LA County and we just released our Ballot Info Tool that you can actually bring with you to vote with in your polling booth!

Your neighborhood pollworker here! 

Just wanted to remind you TUESDAY IS ELECTION DAY. We have a lot of great measures and candidates to choose from, no matter what side of the spectrum you're on.

If you're like me, you do a Vote By Mail (VBM), so make sure to turn those in. If you don't want to do a VBM, but signed-up for it and wish to vote in-person at the polls, make sure your bring your VBM and surrender it. If you cannot physically walk into a poll, remember we have curbside voting. If you have arthritis, remember we have those little balls to help your cutie hands! If you are blind or illiterate, remember we have an audio booth! If you don't speak English, we carry instructions in nearly every language! You need a magnifying glass? Guess what! We got that shit, too!

I don't care what you believe in or where you come from, but I care about whether or not you VOTE. Do your research, pick your sides, and get on in there! I love you, you're beautiful, and I can't wait to say ""hi"" to you at the polls on Tuesday should you decide to walk-in (well, if you walk-into my location, at least). VOTE VOTE VOOOOOOTTTTTEEE!!!

Don't forget to tell your friends to vote!! You may also turn your VBM into a polling place if you still haven't got to it and don't want to vote at the polls! EDIT: I THINK I'M ACTUALLY WRONG ON THIS. WE WILL HAVE YOU SURRENDER IT AND YOU WILL NEED TO VOTE AT THE POLLING PLACE. NOT SURE. ANOTHER ELECTION OFFICIAL DOWN THERE SAID WE DO COLLECT 'EM AT THE POLLING PLACE. I CAN'T REMEMBER AND I'M JUST A NEWBIE (MY SECOND ELECTION), SO BE PREPARED FOR EITHER SCENARIO.

I like to discuss theoretical and humane solutions to some of these problems. I wish our tax dollars went towards helping the homeless get back on their feet, or even universal basic income, but barring that, what can be done?


If someone provided a solution that you loved or hated, be sure to respond to the comment about why you think it's a great/terrible idea.


I would start by saying the problem first, then providing some solutions. For example:


--------------------


I'd like to address the flea epidemic as well as the garbage on the streets problem. I have several possible solutions for this that are based on MOBILITY. Meaning it will ensure that someone can move with their things if such a need arises.

1- this solution is space based, the homeless would be allowed to retain as many things as can fit inside a 35 gallon trash bags with the bag fully closed and not stretched in any way. This will allow for easy police enforcement.... If it's obvious their things can't fit in a 35 gallon bag then they are required to put their things in a bag provided by the police, and city workers will come dispose of the rest. I think this is more than fair as several backpacking bags can fit inside a 35gal bag, including a tent...etc.

Homeless are allowed two transportation vehicles such as a bicycle which is not included in this restriction.

2- this solution is weight based. The homeless will be allowed any amount of things that they can personally carry, by weight. The police will provide a weighted backpack for testing purposes and a scale. Homeless allowed to keep all items up to that weight and city workers will despose of the rest.

Again transportation vehicles like bikes exempt.",LosAngeles,Let's brainstorm some humane and fair laws to help with the homeless crisis,3

From what I’ve read, the best way to find an apartment from out of state is to plan a trip out to LA for a week or two and get a feel for the neighborhoods, see the places in person to make sure it’s not a scam, etc.

The issue there is money.. if I was unemployed and had all free time in the world, and had 10 grand on standby, maybe it wouldn’t be an issue but for someone working full time paycheck-to-paycheck, I don’t see how it’s feasible to pay for a round trip ticket to LA, then pay for a week or two in an AirBnB/motel, plus living expenses like food for that time. And that’s not including the actual move (Uhaul expenses, hotels to overnight while driving cross country etc). Also it will be pretty much impossible to schedule off work for a week or two for the scouting trip.

Let’s say just for example the move date would be June 1. Optimistically, and for the sake of the example, say I get a job offer in LA in late May, but obviously don’t get any money from that job until I move there and start working. I can save up a bit of money in the months before the move but that will all go towards the deposit on the new place and the cross country move.

&gt; *""Most economists agree rent control is bad""*

  * Most economists that subscribe to *classical* economics think it’s bad, and [the last survey of ""most economists"" hasn't been conducted since 1990.](https://econjwatch.org/File+download/238/2009-01-jenkins-reach_concl.pdf?mimetype=pdf). 

Some people in r/California_Politics tried to claim her findings were invalid because she had recently graduated from CSUN at the time, but this very paper was cited by Pastor, Carter and Abood in their recent USC Dornlife study on Rent control released in October 2018.
    
&gt; ""To my knowledge, the last time U.S. economists were surveyed on rent con-trol was in 1990, in the survey of Alston, Kearl, and Vaughan (1992).""

  * NYT-based economist [Paul Krugman also alludes](https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html) to this study conducted in 1992 study by the American Economic Association. It can be found [here](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2117401?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). Unfortunately you have to pay for it to view it, afaik.

Takeaway: I'm of the opinion that people would be less inclined to accept that point if they were made aware of the fact that the consensus is 28 years old. If you still take that as consensus, you take that as consensus, but the fact of the matter is that consensus was established when the global economy was unrecognizable from it was today.

No on 10 advocates on the sub like to cite [this IGM panel survey](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/rent-control). But they leave out everything about the panel that would lead any objective observer to dismiss it as partisan.

   * It is only a ""survey"" of 42 economists. It is in no way a consensus.
 
   * The panel is selected by the Booth School of Business of the University of Chicago. [The University of Chicago is the spiritual home of classical economics](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Chicago-school-of-economics), which champions free-market ideology. It is so closely associated with free-marketing thinking that ""Chicago School of Economics"" or ""Chicago School"" is used interchangeably with ""free-market thinking""

   * The panel survey includes eight Chicago School economists. There are only nine different schools represented. 

When I originally wrote this in r/California_Politics, people harped on how ""respected"" the University of Chicago was, but there have been several studies by “top-tier” universities that counter the anti-rent control opinion of the majority of the panel:

 * [Pastor, Carter &amp; Abood](https://dornsife.usc.edu/assets/sites/242/docs/Rent_Matters_PERE_Report_Web.pdf) out of USC’s Dornlife school wrote about how rent-control is key to achieving housing stability, and that economists “[overstate downsides and understate benefits](https://twitter.com/dillonliam/status/1050140410465607685)”

 * [Alisa Katz of the UCLA Luskin Center for History and Policy argued](http://luskincenter.history.ucla.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/66/2018/09/People-Are-Simply-Unable-to-Pay-the-Rent.pdf), among other policy solutions, to repeal Costa-Hawkins as her top policy recommendation.

 * [Montojo, Barton &amp; Moore](http://haasinstitute.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/haasinstitute_rentcontrol.pdf) of the UC Berkeley Haas Institute for a Fair and Inclusive Society expressly called for rent control. 

 &gt; These challenges call for policy that stabilizes rents in the near term. In taking action to address the housing crisis, our policy goal must be first and foremost about people, not units. It must center on creating true belonging—structural inclusion where institutions and policies meet and are responsive to people's needs. Rent control policies can lay a foundation for this goal by providing a cost-effective, immediate, and widespread effect of stabilizing rents. 

Takeaway: The only ""recent"" consensus of economists cited by anti-Rent control advocates is not a consensus, held by a school with an ideological bias against rent control, with a panel disproportionately representing said biased school, and economists as a whole tend to downplay the benefits and play up the costs of rent control.

&gt; *""There is mountain of evidence that rent control drives up rents for other people""*

 * There isn't a mountain of evidence for *anything* on rent control. There's a lot of theoretical reasoning using classical thought, but little empirical research. There was [this Stanford University study](https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/DMQ.pdf), and it got a lot of press by virtue of the fact that there is little empirical research on rent control expansion, as [Matt Levin, Data reporter for CALMatters, explains on the LATimes/CALMatters housing crisis podcast ""Gimme Shelter""](https://soundcloud.com/matt-levin-4/is-rent-control-good-or-bad-with-aids-healthcare-president-michael-weinstein) on 12:08 of the episode.  

&gt; *""It will discourage construction""*

 * This is a link to the [State of California's Finance Department web page on historical housing construction permits in California](http://www.dof.ca.gov/Forecasting/Economics/Indicators/Construction_Permits/) and how they compare to the united States. [This is a graphical representation of constructed units in California](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bgRoP-viLUchCe4zRmtiwFFDPLjum9CzycYQT86SwyE/edit?usp=sharing), it also includes a graphical representation of percentage change year-to-year in California housing unit construction compared to the United States as a whole, a 10 years before and 10 years after view of rent control implementation in California, and this is a 10 years before and 10 years after view of Costa-Hawkins implementation in 1995.

 * Those four graphs lead to one conclusion: Construction of housing units in California largely followed the US economy overall and rent control appears to not have had a strong discouragement of construction, nor did Costa-Hawkins foster construction growth, outside of the larger economic cycle.  

 * [This is a graphical representation of housing construction permits](https://twitter.com/dillonliam/status/999357729666813952) as shared by *LA Times* housing reporter, Liam Dillon. There is no evidence to suggest that Costa-Hawkins fostered growth of housing construction, and in fact, in the years followed, there was the housing boom in the US but the ""growth"" that followed the passing of Costa-Hawkins was tepid compared to previous growth cycles, and continues to be tepid now post-recession.


&gt; *""Rent control incentivizes landlords to take units off the market.""*

  * Weird how when people bring this up, they don't mention the [Ellis Act](https://hcidla.lacity.org/Ellis-Act), which ""provides landlords in California with a legal way to go out of the rental market business"", and [this work by KCET](https://www.kcet.org/shows/city-rising/mapping-ellis-act-evictions-throughout-california) shows a mapping of Ellis Act evictions, and illustrates how the Ellis Act was used as a tool of gentrifying developers and took units off market. The Ellis Act was used to target rent-controlled buildings, and coupled with Costa-Hawkins, and therefore became an instrument to deplete the supply of rent controlled buildings, driving up rents ever further. [The LA Podcast articulates this well around 48:30 until about 49:20](https://lapodcast.simplecast.fm/bb00c247)

  * Dr. Miriam Zuk of UC Berkeley [found the following](http://www.urbandisplacement.org/blog/rent-control-key-neighborhood-stabilization): 

&gt; ""When we looked at housing production numbers from 2007 to 2013, the six cities that had rent control in the Bay Area actually produced more housing units per capita than cities without rent control.""

Takeaway: That rent-control reduces the housing supply is a deliberately misleading point that blames market forces, at least in part, by a California Act (the Ellis Act), that streamlined this process and served as a self-fulfilling prophecy. 

&gt; *""Rent control decreases landlords' incentive to maintain units""*

  * No it doesn't. If it did, [shit like this wouldn't be posted on the sub](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/820rsz/what_are_we_supposed_to_do_our_landlord_hired_day/), [or this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/8eeylo/landlord_took_away_my_parking_for_citymandated/), [or this](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/3jopke/landlords_lease_claims_trash_will_a_utility_they/)

And I can’t find any study that actually *measures* quality of units, market or rent-controlled.

&gt; *""Michael Weinstein/AHF supports this. Fuck that.""* 

  * This might be the most frustrating part of explaining Yes on 10. The fact of the matter is this: Yes, Weinstein is a fucking NIMBY, and his pushing of Measure S illustrates as much. There's no getting around that and I know very well the bad-faith anti-rent control trolls will harp on that so I might as well address that. 

  * The LA Podcast episode [""Love Don't Costa Thing""](https://lapodcast.simplecast.fm/bb00c247) discusses Weinstein, his history, and their general dislike of him starting on 16:45. As they say later in the episode, his motives for supporting Prop 10 is to earn some progressive bona fides. But the No on 10 advocates cherry pick the fact they provide most of the funding as if various tenants unions and the democratic party of CA *don't* support prop 10. 

Takeaway: Weinstein's involvement has allowed the No on 10 to demonize the opposition, and for ""both-sides"" pundits to cry their favorite tune. 

&gt; *“People who don’t enjoy the benefit of rent control get screwed”*

This implies it’s a zero sum relationship. It’s not. [Gimme Shelter’s](https://calmatters.org/articles/gimme-shelter-podcast-rent-control-good-bad/) analysis of the Stanford Rent Control study pointed out the following on rent control on those who do and do not benefit from rent control starting on 21:37:

&gt; “If you compare those figures, and you say a $7 billion dollar gain [for those benefiting from rent-control] and a $5 billion dollar loss [for those not benefitting from rent-control], it looks like there is a net gain, at least among renters, that would be true according to this study”

Basically, the sum of cost of this decision is outweighed by the sum of benefit, and those who are benefitting from it disproportionately need the help.

&gt; “Real Estate Developers/Landlords need to make a return on their investment”

* Liam Dillon on a [recent Gimme Shelter episode explaining the housing ballot measures](https://soundcloud.com/matt-levin-4/explaining-rent-control-and-everything-else-on-your-ballot-with-damien-goodmon-and-steve-maviglio), explained the Yes on 10 talking point challenging this. 

&gt; “So there’s generally an argument that should be able to charge what they want because they  put money into these properties so they are entitled to a return on that investment. But the problem, over the last decade in particular, in California, you’ve had a huge run-up in property values that has had little to do with actual landlord investment in property and a whole lot to do with the overall housing shortage. Plus, long-time property owners are taxed at really low rates because of Prop 13. So rent control, as a policy, would allow tenants to share in some of these property value gains that landlords now enjoy exclusively alongside their low taxes while they have not put a lot in to increase those property values as much as they have. 

Basically, the risk for real estate investment has been much lower than it has been lately because the ROI on that investment is amplified due to the housing shortage and tax benefits of prop 13. Rent Control would be a reflection of those benefits much in the same way Prop 13 was for property owners. 

**Problems with proposed alternatives to ease housing affordability**

&gt; *“Building more housing is the only way to fix the housing crisis”*

I’m pro-growth. Period. But the YIMBY folks miss two key points when they talk about increasing supply as the best way to solve this. First, there is the fact that development is not created equal, and luxury development is actually resulting in higher vacancy rates becaus they have priced too many people out of the market, [and have been offering free initial rent and parking just to attract higher-income renters](https://la.curbed.com/2017/9/15/16316040/downtown-la-high-vacancy-rate-rent). Remember when people were talking about rents coming down back in January? That was all Class A housing like that which had priced people out and included the free rents meant to even get people interested.

Second, consider how long it will take to construct enough supply to “drive down rent”. Newsome is very likely going to win on Tuesday. He also had of the primary candidates, and has compared to Cox, *by far* the most ambitious housing construction plan: He wants to build 500,000 units every year for seven years. 

Which isn’t going to happen. You could ruthlessly cut down regulations and we would still get no where near that number. Refer back to the [graphical representation of historical rates of housing units construction in California](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bgRoP-viLUchCe4zRmtiwFFDPLjum9CzycYQT86SwyE/edit#gid=924474278). We’ve only built more than 300,000 *twice* since 1963. We haven’t built at half that rate since 1988, we haven’t built at a fourth of that rate since 2007, and with the exception of last year, we hadn’t built at a *fifth* of that rate since 2008.

If we even got back to the levels we were building before 1988, and remember that is half the rate we need it to be to get it done in seven fucking years, we wouldn’t fill the shortage until 2032, if we go at the rate we have been going, it’ll be more like 2046.

That’s too fucking long. We need something in the mean time. 

&gt; *“Rent control isn’t means-tested. Millionaires could benefit from it. They should make it means tested”*

Recalling that [Stanford study from before](https://web.stanford.edu/~diamondr/DMQ.pdf), there is reason to be skeptical of that. 

&gt; “We find that treated individuals, i.e. those who received rent control, ultimately live in census tracts with lower house prices, lower median incomes,lower college shares, and higher unemployment rates than the control group.”

It was also racially equitable

&gt; We see further evidence that racial minorities disproportionately benefited from rent control when looking at the impact of the law on remaining in San Francisco. 

Also, alluding back to Matt Levin, housing reporter for CALMatters, he has pointed out the problem with means-testing for rent control as “[practically difficult to execute](https://soundcloud.com/matt-levin-4/why-rent-control-died-in-the-capitol-with-asm-david-chiu)”.

&gt; “We should just offer a tax credit to help out renters”

 * Some people like to talk about tax credits for renters, but that doesn’t make any fucking sense. If I can’t pay my rent *now* what good will it do me to apply for a tax credit in april, seeing as I will likely get kicked out before then and therefore not even qualify! 

&gt; “There is a better way to implement this than straight repeal of Costa-Hawkins”

Again, Dillon explains this well. (Some background, a rent control initiative died in the state legislature last year and there is every indication that it will always be difficult if it’s ever brought up again.)

**Next, it's worth looking at the talking points of No on 10**

&gt; ""It has no provisions for the Homeless, Seniors, Veterans""

  * Prop 10 does one thing: Repeal Costa-Hawkins. Costa-Hawkins did three things, [per CurbedLA](https://la.curbed.com/2018/1/12/16883276/rent-control-california-costa-hawkins-explained): ""It protects a landlord’s right to raise the rent to market rate on a unit once a tenant moves out, It prevents cities from establishing rent control—or capping rent—on units constructed after February 1995, [and ] It exempts single-family homes and condos from rent control restrictions."" That's it. There are no provisions in Costa-Hawkins for the groups No on 10 is allegedly concerned about. 

&gt; ""Makes the Homeless crisis worse"": 

  * Rising rents contribute to homelessness. Period. A [study last year](http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-rent-increase-homelessness-20170802-story.html) claimed that even a 5% increase would put 2,000 people into homelessness. Rent-control ordinance caps rent growth at 3%. As I will show later, coupled with the fact above we are on track for a depleted supply of rent-controlled units due to the Ellis Act and Costa-Hawkins, we are on track to have no rent controlled units, and non-rent controlled areas are suffering even worse than rent-controlled environments. 

 &gt; ""Will create a Housing Freeze"" 

  * [As I've explained elsewhere](https://www.reddit.com/r/LosAngeles/comments/9pvvoj/lies_your_landlord_is_telling_voters_about_rent/e85jacm/?context=3), Proposition 10 seeks to do only two things: Repeal the three sections that made Costa-Hawkins Law, and add one section granting power to local legislators to implement rent control. That's it. There is nothing in the language to suggest there should be a curb on construction. It's an extrapolation of the ""discourages construction argument"" which I've already addressed.
 
**Next, it's worth pointing out who is funding No on 10, especially given that No on 10 has outraised Yes on 10 by $50,040,303 and is mostly funded by apartment associations, rental housing associations, real estate investors, real estate brokers, Single Family Home investors, and property management groups** 


Source: [Secretary of State](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/transparency/top-contributors/nov-18-gen.html). Many of these contributors divide up their contributions to make it more difficult to show their “total” contribution. I’ve tried to illustrate the groups the group totals through screen caps. 

What’s frustrating about this is the sheer opacity of their funding structure. Let’s start as broad as possible, with the comittees. There are eight “committees” funding the No on 10 campaign:

	
 * No on Prop 10; Californians for Responsible Housing, a Coalition of Veterans, Seniors, Affordable Housing Providers, Social Justice Groups, Taxpayer Associations, and Labor; Sponsored by the California Apartment Association: $53,521,228

 * I wanted to know the breakdown of that group. [This an Google Sheet-converted excel file that shows the unique contributions to this committee.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nGLDrn_AoQjjquYXZGm5vT3vn3qcYx2pnqFs8ehG_zk/edit?usp=sharing). This file, unfortunately, is only update to account for about $43 million of the $53 million total, so it doesn’t capture the most recent contributions. However, what we can say about 80% of the contributions to this committee is *something*. 

  * $40,599,875.00 is from non-human entities/firms, about 92.39%
  * $11,701,371.45 is from **out of state** non-human entities/firms &amp; individuals
  * Of the $3,238,558.36, or 7.37%, that did list an individual’s occupation, about $1,637,779 or 50.57% came from occupations related to housing development, management, investing, brokering or ownership. $1,349,272.97, or 41.67% of the individual total came from Legal, Financial, or Corporate occupations. Only $42,552.96 came from educators, civil servants, engineers, healthcare professionals and social workers. $208,953.43 came from “Other” which included any occupation I couldn’t categorize into the previously listed ones without tedious cross-referencing of employer listing. $104,430.76, or 0.24% is unaccounted for and likely from unlisted occupations of individuals. 

 * No on Prop 10 - A Flawed Initiative that will Make the Housing Crisis Worse a Coalition of Housing Advocates, Renters, Large and Small Businesses, Taxpayer Groups, and Veterans

 * [This is the google-sheet converted excel file that shows the unique contributions to this committee](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12FFxM1CiGAzYLXZH4nPNIdNzsGVhMnelYtGvxIEIBMA/edit?usp=sharing). There appear to be some deductions that need to be made from this file, as it’s actually *more* than the stated total, but it’s less than a million. 

 * $18,802,839.20, or 89.12%, was from non-human entities/firms. 
 * $5,424,548.00 or 25.71% was from out of state firms and individuals.
 * $2,003,700.00 or 87.28% of all individual contributions were from just property owners (92.89% of all individual contributions came from occupations related to housing development, ownership, management, investment or transaction
 * Only 0.05% came from occupations that weren’t involved in the later group, or any occupation in the Legal, Corporate or Financial field.

There are, of course, six other committees, but combined they are a fraction of the above two, it’s a better use of your attention span to talk about the biggest non-human entity contributors. For the following, scroll down to the Opposing group for Proposition 10 on [this link](http://www.fppc.ca.gov/transparency/top-contributors/nov-18-gen.html)

They are best categorized by what area of housing they are involved in:

 * Real Estate Investing
  
  * Essex Properties: $6,616,200
  * Equity Residential: $5,224,900
  * AvalonBay Communities: $4,206,100
  * Western National Group (via Michael K Hayde &amp; “Affiliated Groups”): $4,761,840
  * Marcus &amp; Millichap (via George M Marcus &amp; “Affiliated Groups”: $2,350,000
  * UDR, Inc: $1,807,650  
  * Prometheus Real Estate Group: $1,585,500
  
 * Single Family Home Investors

  * Blackstone: $6,172,834
  * Invitation Homes: $1,286,250

 * Proper Management

  * Spieker: $779,900
  * Lyon Managmemnt (via Frank T. Survay and “Affiliated Groups): $228,250

 * Real Estate Developer
 
  * Lewis Pacific: $1,000,000
  * Amel Development: $250,000

 * Real Estate Broker
  * Liponsky $20,000 

This next one is probably the most heinous when, even though the value is relatively small. 

[$500,000 from PhRMA](https://www.statnews.com/2018/09/19/phrma-opposing-a-rent-control-measure-in-california/), presumably for the following reason from the linked article: 

 &gt; ""But some people here suspect that PhRMA is using its financial clout to settle an old political score with Michael Weinstein, a longtime HIV/AIDS activist who has repeatedly tangled with the drug industry, most recently by bankrolling a set of state-level ballot measures aimed at capping drug prices.""


Lovely bunch, really. 

So if the misleading, faulty or simply baseless claims aren't enough, or the nefarious, greedy nature of its sponsors isn't enough, here's a case for Prop 10 itself. 

First, it's important to remember that **PROP 10 IS ONLY A REPEAL OF COSTA-HAWKINS, AND MERELY GIVES THE OPTION OF RENT CONTROL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IT IS NOT AN EXPANSION OF RENT CONTROL**. 

So why is that distinction important? 

Well, consider the fact that Costa-Hawkins banned rent control on single family homes, and Blackstone, [which has given $6,859,747 to No on 10](https://theintercept.com/2018/10/12/prop-10-california-rent-control-wall-street/), has bought up so many single family homes in the past decade they [are now the single largest player in the SFR market](https://calmatters.org/articles/data-dig-big-investment-firms-have-stopped-gobbling-up-california-homes/). 

&gt; ""Through its residential investment-focused subsidiary, Invitation Homes, Blackstone is now the largest owner of single-family homes nationwide. In California, they own about 13,000 homes."" 

And per the same article, there was an increase of ~450,000 single family rentals in the past decade, and a drop of single-family-owned homes of about ~50,000.

Next, consider the fact that vacancy decontrol incentivizes landlords to bully tenants, as I have shown earlier in this write-up. This Prop 10 battle is making subtext text, so to speak, and now [at least one landlord is bullying their tenants into voting No on 10.](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-may-2018-los-angeles-landlord-pledges-to-cancel-1538090659-htmlstory.html)


But, the big question: ""Are we better off with rent control, even bearing in mind that this is only a vote to make that an option?""


**Analysis of LA County Rent-Controlled and Non-Rent-Controlled cities &amp; towns.**

As noted above, there is little empirical research on rent control expansion. There was, however, [research via simulation by the Bay Area Economic council](http://www.bayareaeconomy.org/report/solving-the-housing-affordability-crisis-alameda/) on what would happen if you *removed* rent control, along with about 19 other factors affecting housing affordability in the Bay Area. They found that removing rent control was *by far* the worst thing you can do to housing affordability. [It would put 16,000 Bay Area residents into rent-burdened status overnight](https://www.kqed.org/news/11677380/is-rent-control-working-and-should-we-have-more-or-less-of-it). Couple this fact with the one I made above about the diminishing supply of rent-controlled units in LA via the freezing of new rent-controlled units and the streamlining of their destruction via the Ellis Act, and you have a bleak forecast of what LA will look like for housing affordability. 

But, you may ask, what *would* a non-rent controlled LA look like? 

I tried to figure that out myself using median rent data and related metrics from [Princeton University's Eviction Lab](https://evictionlab.org/map/). 
 I downloaded the California dataset, which includes nearly all California Cities and towns from 2000-2016, and went through to find 145 LA County cities and towns, and created a sub-dataset to look at. Note that there are four cities with rent-control in LA: the City of Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, and West Hollywood. 

I then did a quick comparison of all non-rent-controlled cities and towns and compared them to the four rent-controlled cities. [You can view that comparison here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KZo2rGdUmOY0_EIgnK0neV2f5yrsMymPSxSUrlGOWsE). The top left graph does indeed show that the median rent was higher in the rent controlled cities, and the bottom left show that it took up a greater rate of wages compared to the non-rc cities. But the other two graphs poke holes in citing these as anti-rent-control evidence: The median income was notably lower in the RC areas, which provided a lower denominator for the rent-wage ratio in the RC cities and therefore inflating the percentage, and furthermore, the rent-burden was *lower* in the RC cities. 

What's more, the four rent-controlled cities are very different. To standardize those differences, I found the percentile rank of each and every town and city, each year, and then compared the ranks of the four cities, [which you can view here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BmjyWQh-nwb5tdTQKkauZwm473AiOhW0C7smULS3iN0). 

You'll see that Los Angeles is consistently diametrically opposed to Santa Monica and Beverly Hills on nearly every metric, being that they are on opposite sides of the 50th percentile, and the few time they are, they are separated by 40 points ore more. So I compared just Los Angeles to [all Non-Rent Controlled Areas](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1pdeQhij08D547P4P4-N821a276ASfNtGgDtYleykvDQ). LA median rent is actually slightly lower compared to non-RC towns and cities, and the low median income, not rent, is driving the inaffordability of LA in that the ""median"" wage-rent ratio, rent-burdened percent and poverty rates are all much higher in Los Angeles. 

It's also worth noting that when [you look at the breakdown of percent rent-burdened in non-rent-controlled areas by race](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GWitSZjRAthreHK-MTB2MR1OOaN11pZUFVfCGNViRxo), an ugly picture emerges that clearly shows how much better off White people are compared to Blacks and Hispanics: As an area becomes less white and more hispanic or black, the more that area is rent-burdened.

Now, you could reasonably ask, well, what about LA compared to comparably diverse non-rent-controlled areas then? I took the percent Hispanic in LA in a given year and compared metrics of areas that were +/-5% that level in a given year and then looked at all the years, [which you can view here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=18CoHAS6mhOZZo2mOrnb7UBDc6ywui-C3KNjMDyxs3wg). The fact is the same pattern plays out when compared to all non-rent-controlled areas with a similar demographic racial make-up, albeit by smaller margins in absolute terms.

The fact of the matter is rent-control has protected people here in LA in the face or rent growth (+79.91%) doubling median income growth (+36.84%). As shown above in explaining the Ellis Act in combination with Costa-Hawkins, we face a future that will deplete the RC-housing supply, and be left with a non-RC world that is shown to be racially discriminatory. We are also at the mercy of corporate landlords like Blackstone if we continue to allow a law that bars rent-control on single-family homes. Vacancy Decontrol will only continue a practice of bullying tenants by landlords. 

**So, to wrap up, here are the bullet points as to why you should vote Yes on 10.**

 * Most arguments against rent-control are based on classical economy theory that do not align with data around housing construction or median rent in California/LA County, respectively. 

 * Nearly the entirety of No on 10 is funded by corporate landlords, developers and investors, and the handful of individual financial contributors work in real estate investment, brokerage, realty, and development, and of the remainder that aren’t nearly all those in law, finance or the corporate world. There’s noting *wrong* with those professions in and of themselves, but it illustrates who benefits from this. 

 * The alternative proposed solutions - increased construction, affordable housing subsidies, means-testing - would likely take decades to implement, be more expensive, or are simply not practical to implement.


 * Rent-control has been show to disproportionately protect racial minorities and the economically vulnerable, and the increase of rent of non-RC units is offset by the benefits bestowed to this group.

 * Rent control offers a protection from increased homelessness, the cost of which for enforcing punitive efforts to criminalize the homeless, to say nothing of funding for housing for the homeless or healthcare treatment, is considerably larger than the likely percentage increase in rent for non-rent-controlled individuals. 

 * Rent control, due to redevelopment through buyouts, Ellis Act evictions and buildings simply getting too old will mean that rent-control will eventually go extinction thanks to Costa-Hawkins. 

 * Which would mean that cities that are low-wage and majority-minority will especially suffer as EvictionLab data shows that areas that lack rent control are economically discriminatory.

 * Even if you think Prop 10 will lose, there is *still* an argument to vote for it, because the margin itself will dictate the course of the conversation in the future. Again, from Dillon on that recent Gimme Shelter episode

&gt; Dillon:  “The margin is important.If you have [it] losing, say, 55-45 or even 60-40, that’s something very different than 70-30, right? That margin is really important to show how much sway that advocates might have moving forward within the larger conversation all of us expect to have about housing issues in the state coming forward in the state legislature in the next year. 

&gt; Levin: “I agree with that. What if the margins end up being to what the polls say? What if it gets in the 30s?

&gt; Dillon: “I think that’s really poor. I think it’s a really poor showing. I think that means less leverage. I think that means apartment owners can say “Look, I understand the Yes side was outspent 3 to 1, but $25 million is not a small chunk of change, and there was a big robust effort to do something here, at a time of unprecedented housing unaffordability, and this is all you got?” So that’s a real argument that, while there gonna have the upperhand in this world were talking about, really have a lot more leverage to do what they want here, and not give much of anything at the table [in the future]”

So even if Prop 10 loses by *double-digits* there are still degrees of consequences the wider and wider the margin gets. So you should ask yourself: Do you want to give corporate landlords and investment groups *even more* leverage than they already have?



We must end Costa-Hawkins. Vote Yes on 10.

I’m posting for my friend who recently lost her cat in North Hollywood. Any help would be appreciated! Below is a link to their Facebook PawBoost Alert.

AGATE was lost on November 1, 2018 in Los Angeles, CA 91601 near Huston St and N Vineland Ave. 

Agate is a black and white cat. He has a black nose, white chest, and has a white spot on his back. He is shy, unfamiliar with the area, and may be disoriented after surgery and meowing.

If more housing is the goal, wouldn't changing the zoning and making development requirements more lax (IE, less parking spots, no balcony, etc, etc) be more effective? I'm sure making any changes so dramatic would be like pulling teeth and I'm back to my original question of, why not do something, even baby steps towards more housing.

Anyone willing to briefly share their reasons for going one way or another on this?

There are good arguments for both candidates. Alex Villanueva promises to reform the Department [""around the principles of community policing and ethical standards of conduct,""](https://alexvillanueva.org/about/) and he has endorsements by the LA County Democratic Party and The Association For Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs. He is a military veteran and was an LASD officer who spoke out against Lee Baca and Paul Tanaka.

&amp;#x200B;

McDonnell is an experienced Sheriff who was the [""second-in-command under Chief of Police Bill Bratton"" for the LAPD and ""served as the Chief of the Long Beach Police Department for five years.""](https://sheriffjimmcdonnell.com/about-sheriff-mcdonnell/) He has endorsements by many Democratic officials, including LA Mayor Garcetti, the California Peace Officers’ Association, and the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/endorsements/la-ed-sheriff-endorsement-20181011-story.html). He is an experienced top-level leader of police departments.

&amp;#x200B;

I will be voting on the 6th, Election Day, and I have been weighing arguments for both sides. Villanueva has been an officer and a lieutenant in the LASD, and he promises to reform the LASD for the better.

""I love comedy but it's so expensive! Drinks are like $10 a pop and you gotta buy at least two of em, and that's if you want the CHEAP comedy shows! Where can I go to get a goddamn amazing comedy experience for little or no money?????????????? Also, one more thing, if it's not too much to ask, can this place of amazing comedy also be a taco shop with the absolute most delicious tacos in all of Los Angeles run by a family with blood heritage intricately intertwined with the very history of such a amazingly tasty meal?""

.

Well my friend, let me introduce you to the MAGIC that is the ""Comedy Night At Best Fish Taco""! Yes, this is all of our dreams come to fruition in real life. A Taco Restaurant, that sits RIGHT NEXT TO a liquor store THAT ALLOWS YOU TO BRING YOUR OWN BOOZE while you watch ABSOLUTELY FREE COMEDY and eat MOUTHWATERING fish tacos!

.

This show gets REALLY REALLY CROWDED even on the COLDEST of nights. For this reason we go and we grab some chairs for everyone EARLY. The show is supposed to start at 7:30 but it usually starts late at 8. In order to grab FRONT ROW SEATS, we usually get in there around 7:00-7:30 and we start drinking and socializing.... Sometimes we bring a board game, or card game to play while we wait for the awesomeness to unfold. By the time the show starts, everyone is liquored up and ready to have a good time!

.

============================NOW, HERE IS THEIR OWN (Loud Village, the people that put this show on) PROMOTIONAL WORDING FOR THE MEETUP===============================

.

Comedy Night at Best Fish Taco is going down this Tuesday, March 6th! Starting at 8pm(ish), there will be standup comedy going on under the outdoor cabana of Best Fish Taco, presented by Loud Village. This event is totally FREE. Come laugh, have a drink, and enjoy some delicious (and cheap!) tacos. 8pm-9:45pm.

.

As always, the event will feature an amazing lineup TBA...

It would only be about 4 hours and some change out of your day for a fun afternoon.

Hello everyone! So here is the huge favor i would ask of someone if they could please help me out! So, i got tickets to the show To Tell The Truth on November 18th 2018, 3;45 pm, it is being taped at **CHANDLER VALLEY STUDIOS 13927 SATICOY ST. PANORAMA CITY, CA 91402,** which is a live audience type game show thing. And if i attend the entire taping, then i will receive tickets for the ABC Dancing With The stars. Which is my girlfriends all time favorite show ever, like she is obsessed and wants to go to a live show. The issue is that we live on the East coast, and im willing to fly us out to see DWTS, but in order to redeem the ticket offer and we must attend the first taping of To Tell The Truth. And, because were both in college right now, i cant make that taping as its right as i begin exam week. So, i was going to ask a favor of one of you amazing people if you could go to the taping on November 18th. That is all. The taping is 4 hours and they recommended arriving a little early. But obviously it is free and you wont have to pay for anything, and i am more than willing to pay, I was thinking $125 for 4 hours of going to do something quite fun would be fair! The slight catch is that it has to be 2 people who go, so you would have to bring a friend or an s/o, but i think this actually sounds quite fun and would be a fun date, and as i said i would be willing to pay $125 (We can negotiate!). So yeah, if anyone could do me this favor it would mean the world to my girlfriend and I, Thank you so much!",LosAngeles,"Hey Guys, so i have a favor to ask of anyone in the LA area, Could you attend a Taping of a live show for me, ill pay!",37

Happy Hour 4PM-7PM and Team Trivia at 7PM!

.

Come meet us at ""The Bar"" (found on google as ""The Bronson Bar"") for super Dive bar vibes, great drinks, and team trivia in this old 1920s building.

.

But how do I find you nerds?

.

We're usually an unmistakable group. Very hard to miss. Couple that with the tiny bar you'll most likely see me. If you see me, come up and say hi! If not, I'll probably be watching the door and greeting anyone and everyone who comes in followed up by asking them if they're here for us.

.

You can also ask the bartender where the meetup is. Every bartender knows me by name.

.

There is no kitchen at ""The Bar"" but you're allowed to bring food in. I'll probably order a few pizzas for the group to help soak up that mighty fine whiskey.

.

Come join us, bring your A game for trivia and make new friends!

.

I got a notice for traffic violation from City of Culver City Police department with a notice to appear in the Santa Monica Courthouse on a specific date, for reason: automated traffic enforcement.

I've done research, and I don't think this is a ""snitch ticket.""  It has the photos that clearly show my face and license plate. That being said, this is the only time i've ever ""recognized"" the ticket.

Was considering going through with a payment plan but I am not sure if I am able to take traffic school still and the process to remove any points and prevent rise in my insurance.

&amp;#x200B;

You guys need to check out DWP's AC optimization program!

&amp;#x200B;

I was referred by a neighbor in the DWP incentive for a free A/C tune-up and free Nest Thermostat. I contacted Service Genius and was handled on the phone with care and confidence. I had spoke to William the day he did the work on my neighbors home and was impressed at his experience and thoroughly explaining what they do. On the day of my appt., Josh and Vladimir arrived. William explained that  Josh &amp; Vladimir had been extensively trained in the proper way and the only way that Service Genius expects from their service representatives. William was there before and after the work to inspect and see that I was truly pleased. I have to say that both Vladimir &amp; Josh were very professional and made sure that every component was checked and serviced properly. They cleaned the condenser coils, found and replaced a bad valve that was potentially leaking Freon, added 2 lbs of Freon, replaced the air filter, taped areas of forced air unit to make less sound &amp; more efficient, and installed the Nest Thermostat as well as explained entirely the way it works and help set-up. I was impressed beyond any service call I've had in many years. This saved me hundreds of dollars yet if I had to pay, it would have been worth every penny.

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, what an awesome service! You guys should check it out, who knows how long it will last. 

&amp;#x200B;

BTW, for some reason DWP doesn't tell people about this program?? Like some kind of secret. The tech said if people want to sign up to call them directly and they handle the paperwork, no need to call DWP.

&amp;#x200B;

DWP's site: [https://www.ladwp.com/acopt](https://www.ladwp.com/acopt)

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the company's Yelp page: [https://www.yelp.com/biz/service-genius-chatsworth](https://www.yelp.com/biz/service-genius-chatsworth?start=40)

And their number: (818) 208-6804

&amp;#x200B;

Have a happy halloween and enjoy the Nest!

&amp;#x200B;

TL;DR: Free Nest from DWP's AC optimization program, call (818) 208-6804 and sign up!

Their dog escaped a couple of days ago.  A nearby restaurant said they saw the dog and this van chasing after it.  The security camera's showed this van:

[Picture 1 of the van](https://i.imgur.com/1Y1a6GN.jpg)

[Picture 2 of the van](https://i.imgur.com/dMjtdHL.jpg)

No one knows if the van was able to catch the dog or not.  The owner just wants to contact them and see what happened.  If you know anything about this van, please let me know.

**EDIT:**  License plate number of van:  98581D1 - Dog owner went to W.LA police station earlier today.  They were not willing to release the van's information.  And they said they don't take reports for missing dogs.  

**EDIT-2** [Here is the flyer for missing dog](https://i.imgur.com/RYzTMWs.jpg)  And through a paid website, the dog owner found the [following info on the van](https://i.imgur.com/V9T12uK.jpg).  It's a 2013 Nisan.  But no info on owner contact.

**Update 11/1/18** The van and driver have been located (thanks to someone on Nextdoor and a person on \RBI forum).  The driver followed the dog, but was not successful in catching her.  So she still remains missing.  At least the van/driver mystery has been solved.  Thanks to everyone here for caring and the responses!  I'll post another update if she is found.

**Update 11/2/18** Dog has been found and reunited with owner!!!  A watchful neighbor saw the dog crossing the street and going into someone's driveway in the middle of the night.  She contacted the owner who went there immediately and found her dog!  Dog was missing for approximately 1 week and was found a mile away.

Calimaree,0,1540940916.0,False,False,t3_9sqon4,76,/r/LosAngeles/comments/9sqon4/whose_side_are_you_on_forprofit_ambulance/,"My last ditch effort, guys… I know all you Redditors like evidence, so here’s a thoroughly researched plea to vote NO on Prop 11, Los Angeles.

Prop 11 may sound like a no-brainer, an easy ‘yes’ to mark on your ballot on election day.  Prop 11  [“requires private sector emergency ambulance employees to remain on-call during work breaks.”](http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/11/title-summary.htm) According to the official [Yes on 11 campaign,](http://www.yeson11.org/) a yes vote will “protect public safety” and ensure “that EMTs and paramedics can quickly respond to provide the critical care you need.” Nice, right?

But you know what they say—follow the money.  American Medical Response West (AMR) was the [sole contributor of nearly $22 million](https://www.followthemoney.org/) to the Californians for Emergency Preparedness and Safety committee who paid for the Yes on 11 campaign.

To understand why AMR would spend nearly $22 million to codify common sense practices, it’s necessary to understand current California labor laws and AMR’s history of violating them.

It’s the current industry practice that first responders are entitled to meal breaks determined by the length of their shifts. Workers may be granted those breaks while remaining on duty, but if a call comes in, they immediately end their break and respond to the call. If a break is interrupted in this way, first responders may report the interruption at the end of a shift and be compensated.

In 2017, a group of first responders led by first responder Laura Bartoni alleged they were denied pay for these interrupted rest breaks over several years, filing the lawsuit [Bartoni et al v American Medical Response West](https://law.justia.com/cases/california/court-of-appeal/2017/a143784.html)*.* This case is still pending, but if it settles in favor of the employees, AMR will face huge economic repercussions and this case could set a precedent for other first responders to file suits against AMR and other for-profit ambulance companies.

Separate from the lawsuit against AMR, [the California Supreme Court recently ruled that on-call breaks violate state labor laws in Augustus v. ABM Security Services](http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/11/analysis.htm), a case in which private security guards and their employers who required they keep their radios on during breaks. The court ruled in favor of the workers, that these breaks must be non-interruptible. Due to the similarities of on-call break practices of these two professions, these laws will likely soon apply to first responders. In order to adhere to this ruling and make sure employees get uninterrupted, off-duty breaks, AMR would need to operate more ambulances and have more first responders on duty, increasing costs.

Under Prop 11, AMR seeks to eliminate the possibility for further lawsuits stemming from meal and rest break violations and to circumvent the *Augustus v. ABM Security Services* ruling. AMR will continue operating as they have in the past, save that the industry practice of remaining on call would become law. According to the “No on Prop 11” website (paid for by the American Federation of State, County &amp; Municipal Employees, a council that represents unions) this [“wolf in sheep’s clothing” measure will make first responders jobs more difficult as it strips them of their rights to guaranteed meal and rest breaks.](https://noprop10.org/) This prop could save AMR millions in lawsuit payouts.

Here's where **Los Angeles** comes in big time: Prop 11 sets a one-size-fits-all rule for first responders across the state. [First responders will lose the option of clocking out and taking an uninterrupted rest breaks](http://www.voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/11/analysis.htm) when there are high volumes of calls, which often is the case in population-dense locations like Los Angeles and the Bay Area. When working a 24-hour shift, for example, a constant stream of 911 calls will mean that, by law, a paramedic may not get the chance to eat or rest even for a few minutes. This is absurd. The safety of first responders and the public will be at risk so that  for-profit ambulance companies can further line their pockets.

As a fairly voiceless, unempowered group, first responders haven't yet had their 15 minutes: most industry norms and practices are not documented. You might only know about the poor treatment and compensation of first responders if you know one or are one. Here's a [post](https://old.reddit.com/r/sandiego/comments/9l7hlg/information_about_prop_11/) from a San Diego Redditor and his take, as a paramedic, on Prop 11.

Who's with me? Time is running out and AMR has got all the money on their side. Stand with your first responders, LA!",LosAngeles,Whose side are you on – for-profit ambulance companies or exploited emergency responders?,38

I know Pomona was the place to be back in the 20s-50s, prime real estate, movie companies and stars would go there, very artsy and developed and whatnot. However sometime somewhere something drastically changed and it basically became a mirror of East LA in terms of demographics, culture, and crime, what happened? I read somewhere that in 1999 it was just below Richmond and Compton in highest murder rates in CA. It's geographically pretty far from LA anyway, how did other SGV cities in between not suffer to this extent? Additionally, Pomona's neighboring cities such as La Verne, Walnut, Diamond Bar, and Claremont are fine, with Claremont being extremely well-off. 

That brings in my next point though, why is the Claremont and Pomona dichotomy so severe though? You can see this the second you cross over the city limits. Shouldn't Pomona at least be showing the slightest sign of gentrification or development?  This is a little more anecdotal, but why are the interactions between residents and in each others city so minimal? Wouldn't the colleges help with this? I didn't know Claremont existed at all or that I had some of the best colleges in the world just down the street until I was 12, and when I was 14 I remarked to my sister in a Trader Joes in Claremont that I'd never seen so many white people.

EXACT TIME SUBJECT TO CHANGE. We will do it for exactly one hour. Maybe more if we're all having fun and we want to keep going.

.

Every Year the westboro baptist church comes to protest the West Hollywood halloween carnival. They use these HUGE bullhorns that are so big and loud they put them on poles cause they can't hold them up the whole time.
   
 The whole point is to drown them out for one hour. For one hour, halloween revelers can come and join in on our karaoke, mere feet away from the bigots. So that instead of hearing words of hate, they hear the Prince Ali song over and over and over and over and over and over.... For one hour. Or until the Westboro Baptist Church promises to stop using their bullhorns for the rest of the day. I'll be holding a sign that says ""we'll stop when you stop"".

.

I will have a screen that plays the lyrics for everyone so those that don't know the song can join along. I will also have a big ass speaker (hopefully bigger than theirs) to play the music, but I'm hoping even if my speaker doesn't work, maybe our voices will drown out their speakers.

.

I'm dressing up as PRINCE ALI this year and I welcome everyone else coming to dress up as Prince Ali or Aladdin... Every time we sing the song we can sing it about a different aladdin. so every time we sing, one person can invite us to their gun show and flex like arnold while we all sing along.

.

You don't have to dress up as Prince Ali. You can dress up as whatever you want, but how awesome would it be if we surrounded them with a bunch of Prince Alis and annoyed them into stopping their messages of hate, at least audibly.

.

To all the police men and women guarding the WBC, I'm sorry, but hopefully our karaoke will be more tolerable than their words of hate. I respect you guys for defending their right to say stuff, even though you don't agree with what they're saying. That's what America is all about.

.

If they turn off their megaphones we win.

.

If we drown out their words of hate for an hour, even for an hour, we win.

Abstract20,0,False,False,False,t3_9s6qr1,103,/r/LosAngeles/comments/9s6qr1/49m_from_nyc_why_is_dating_here_so_much_harder/,"I'm pretty surprised at how much of a field of tumbleweeds my dating life is here compared to NYC and want to know if I'm just not doing something right or if this is just how it is here?

I work in a creative field, partner at a niche marketing agency based in NY. I'm 6'3"", in decent shape, look okay for my age, I have been told I'm attractive, Australian accent. I'm pretty laid back overall. In NYC I had so much of a plethora of dating options that it made settling down almost impossible. The women I dated were intelligent, attractive, many above my league even.  

Here I've had 2 dates that have been complete disasters. I'm on okc, tinder, and bumble.  I rarely get matches on dating sites and when I do get matches, it's usually because I get frustrated and start right swiping on everyone. And the matches I get are usually obese, not my type physically, or fake profiles.  

Having lived in NYC most of my adult life I don't know how to drive but Uber has been working fine for me.  Usually I just Uber everywhere and offer to pay for the woman's Uber as well. I don't know if not driving is a red flag for women here? I'm willing to learn I'm just wondering if it's considered a problem here?

I've been careful to choose the right neighborhood.  I sublet for a few months before deciding where to live and it's the same in any neighborhood. No matches.  At bars or restaurants there are no opportunities to meet single women. It's not really a town where people interact with each other. Is online dating not a thing here?  Am I too old?  Not rich enough?  I'm really confused by the lack of matches especially when many of the profiles I come across are of women who don't seem all that interesting, intelligent, or attractive compared to NYC.  Yet by the lack of matches I have to assume it's me and not them.

Why so much success in NYC and none in LA? The women here seem to be much more picky but less quality than the east coast.",LosAngeles,49/m from NYC. Why is dating here SO much harder?,0

Honestly, I'm not *upset* about this issue, exactly-- I'd say I'm just curious about it.

The LAPD is looking for volunteers to go on extra patrols in neighborhoods. The LAPD uses predictive crime mapping to determine where additional patrols are needed. However there are more areas to patrol than there are available officers. The LAPD is asking the civilian public to volunteer to provide extra patrols to deter crime in these areas among other assignments such as traffic control for traffic collisions, missing person searches, and other non-enforcement duties.

The volunteers are assigned black and white BMW i3 all electric vehicles for the patrols. The BMW does not have red and blue lights, and does not pull people over for traffic infractions.

Contact your local police station front desk to sign up. Applicants usually go through a background check, fingerprints, vehicle training, slow speed driving course, radio communications training, and a patrol training. The process usually takes 2 to 3 months. You will need to acquire a uniform after being accepted. The department hopes to add 5,000 volunteers.

[Here is the Inspection Notice](https://i.imgur.com/SDo7Pfe.jpg) 

Its kind of a ""can I use extension cords"" question.

The two outlets near my tank are gfi and have [outlet covers.](https://mobileimages.lowes.com/product/converted/050169/050169917275.jpg) I've done the math and the 20v breaker is more than enough for the amount of power being used... but he said I should be using *only* the outlets and that [surge protectors](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000WJ9VYK/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1) will overload the breaker... Overall he was chill about it but seemed picky/concerned.

He asked that I get an electrician to confirm and send a note.  Its not an official write-up as far as I know (wouldn't I be given a copy?)

I thought the ""no extensions/surge protector"" rule was for businesses.  I'm only vaguely familiar with NFPA 70 (National Electric Code) and there is nothing that would make surge protectors/extensions a no-no for home use.... right? wrong?
  I've also never heard of a home theater or fish tank being considered a ""permanent installation"" like a water heater n such.  

&gt;Landlord's email: ""The City Inspector was there today and discovered you are using multiple extension cords for your fish tanks putting the building and other tenants at risk for fire.  He wrote us up demanding you to get an electrician, at your expense, to solve the problem.

Not a huge deal overall (I hope) but I'm curious if anyone else has experienced this?  Anywhere I can read specific codes for my area (fountain &amp; vista) and get a better understanding of what is required?

I suppose, worst case scenario, is I just spend the $$$ to have an electrician add another outlet just to ease the inspectors mind. 

Anyway, any info/help is appreciated. Thanks!

Being able to walk to the 7th St/Metro Center and hop on any line would be great. I'd also love to be able to walk to theatres, museums, restaurants, and Grand Central Market. I'd finding places in various parts of downtown. My question is: what is the better part of downtown? I know it can be a little sketchy so a safer side would be nice.

samantmd,0,False,False,False,t3_9r3pwr,10,/r/LosAngeles/comments/9r3pwr/need_help_finding_hit_and_run_driver/,"Last night I was driving home to Hollywood from North Hollywood getting on the 101 south ramp from Lauren Canyon blvd.  I had the green arrow to turn left so I did, I saw a white SUV while I was turning come at me from the opposite direction on Laurel Canyon Blvd.  I was mid intersection at this point I honked my horn and the woman driving the car ran her red light and slammed into my literally pushing my car hundreds of feet onto the highway ramp almost making me crash into the wall.  I swear it's a miracle that I'm ok.

I thought the woman driving the car would pull up behind me so we could exchange information but she just drove away leaving me on the freeway ramp.  My breaks stopped working after she hit me and I had to put my car in park in order to stop my car.  I called 911 and was just sitting there in a super dangerous place as cars zoomed by me and I was too scared to get out of my car but scared to stay in it.  

Then a Lyft driver who saw the whole thing pulled up behind me and said I needed to get out of the car or I could get killed waiting there.  She saw the woman back up and do a u-turn and just drive away.  She waited with me at a gas station so the police could take her statement and she could help me.

The police said they aren't going to find her, but the woman that helped me did get the first few numbers of her plates, 89E.  It was a pearl white SUV and I think it likely was a Mazda CX-5 or something very similar looking.  If anyone sees someone driving a car like this that looks like it has damage on the front of their car please take a picture of the plates!  Long shot but I would love to catch this woman.  When she drove away she got on the 101N.

""Take A Seat"" by Dark Road
   
 “Take A Seat” is a narrative-adventure game in which the player learns the story of a husband and wife experiencing a variety of struggles between each other and themselves. The gameplay complements those experiences through indirect means and each gameplay sequence is a variation on a struggle that the couple experienced, but it is played by means of a 3D platformer title while hearing narration from Todd Bridges (Roots, That’s My Boy, Diff’rent Strokes) and a musical score from David Housden (Thomas Was Alone, Volume, Q.U.B.E. 2) as they jump through various contextual obstacles.

hound_dog_pope,0,False,False,False,t3_9r3o91,15,/r/LosAngeles/comments/9r3o91/westwoodcentury_city_lookout_for_possible_scam/,"Hey everyone.  I wanted to post about something unusual that happened to me yesterday (10/23) near the intersection of Westwood Blvd. and Ohio Ave.  I think it might have been a scam, so I wanted to try and make the community aware of it.  Mods, if this is a common scam and I'm just naïve, or if this isn't the kind of thing that belongs on this sub, please just PM me and I'll get rid of it.

As I was pulling into a grocery store parking lot, a guy approached me asking about the fender on my vehicle.  I was frankly surprised he'd noticed it, the damage to the panel was pretty slight.  A couple months ago I'd hit a shopping cart that someone had """"""""conveniently"""""""" left in a parking place just where I couldn't see it as I was pulling in.  Part of the cart got wedged between the left front fender panel and the left front tire. It dislocated the panel, pulling it away from the chassis a bit.  It's not an obvious defect, but if you examine the car closely you can see that the panel isn't flush with the headlight, nor the seam where it should meet the adjacent panel. 

This guy told me that he freelanced doing auto body repairs, and said that he could pop the panel back into place in the parking lot, right then and there.  Since it seemed like a superficially simple repair, I decided to give it a shot (stupid, I know). He produced this device from his trunk (it looked like a giant screwdriver with a threaded screw at the end) and instructed me to turn my car's wheel completely to the right.  He slid the device into the wheel well until he had some purchase on the metal panel, and then he started jerking on the device and pressing his foot against the car for leverage.  After a minute of doing this, it became clear that he wasn't making progress - the panel still wasn't flush with the rest of the car.  In a way, this confirmed my worst suspicion about the damage to the panel: that the steel itself had been bent, and this wasn't simply a matter of popping the panel back into place.

I asked him to stop, saying this clearly wasn't effective.  Instead of stopping though, he went back into his truck, and pulled out a spray can and some Bondo.  He smeared Bondo all over the seam between the damaged panel and the rest of the car.  He then sprayed over the Bondo with some orangish-red automotive paint.  He kept telling me that I could call him on Saturday and he would buff out everything and make it look perfect.  This was when the red flags really started to accumulate.  

At this point, I was really frustrated.  It was clear this guy didn't know what he was doing, and now he was saying that I needed to call him on Saturday for additional work.  Then the biggest red flag of all: he starts demanding the full price of the ""work"" he'd done right there in the parking lot. The price? $350! I told him to get lost.  Smearing Bondo and mismatched paint on someone's car, and then asking for the full price before the work was done?  I guess I must not be the smartest person in the world for letting things get this far, but I'm not that stupid.  I told him I'd give him a small down payment for the ""future work"" on Saturday (I was trying to get him to leave me alone at this point).  I gave him a few bucks, which is a lot of money to give someone for the privilege of having your car made to look like the handiwork of a third world chop shop (no offense to third world chop shops, I'm sure they do better work than this guy).

Then came more red flags - he starts complaining about how that wasn't enough money, and how he'd been using ""high-quality materials"" there in the parking lot.  Even though the can he'd been using clearly said ""Bondo"" on it, he insisted that it was some kind of special fiberglass compound that was superior to Bondo.  Eventually, he relented, took the few bucks I'd given him and left.  

What's embarrassing is that I like to think I'm pretty immune to nonsense like this.  In hindsight, it was obvious that he was using two pretty well-known psychological tricks: the anchoring effect (he gets me to try and talk him down from an ""anchoring"" price of $350 dollars, when I shouldn't have given him anything) and a kind of ""monkey trap"" fallacy (now that your car has cosmetic damage, I'm the only one who can fix it, keep paying me until it's better).  What's sad is I studied this stuff in graduate school and I still fell for it :(  

Anyway, be on the lookout.  He was probably in his 40's, about 5'9"" was driving a late-model cream-colored Mercedes Benz.  I think he was either Middle-Eastern or Latin American, but no accent.  Had black, wavy hair that almost covered his ears, and his face was a little bit pock-marked.

I’m ashamed to say I fell for a somewhat elaborate apartment scam and thought I’d share some of the details to hopefully prevent some people falling for the same trap. Sorry for the long read.

Wasn’t your standard “wire us money upfront” scheme, there were a few layers to it. I saw an ad on craigslist for a studio that was cheaper than most other rentals on the market but nothing blatantly suspicious. I reach out via text to “Angel” who says he is the leasing agent and he tells me that I can go see the unit if I’m in the area and proceeds to give me the lockbox code which he says is on the door. No alarms so far.

I drive to the unit, open up the lockbox and the key works just fine. I look around the apartment, everything is as-pictured and clean. Looks ready to move in. I’ve been hustling and jostling for an apartment for over a week at this point (maybe a bit too trigger happy) and I text him that I’d like to immediately move forward with an application. He tells me that the management company will send me an email with an application shortly. 

I receive the email later from “Tarim Scott” of Sun Realty Property Management who’s based in San Francisco. I put together the supporting documents he asks for (DL, SS number, proof of income) and tell him I can bring the required cashiers check to his manager or office if I’m approved. At this point I’m still a little skeptical because of a few spelling mistakes in the email exchange and the fact I’m now dealing with two people. I think I overlook these red flags because I’m so anxious to secure my living arrangements. 

Two days go by and then I receive an approval letter from Tarim. Yay for me! Looks completely legit. I send it to my brother who works in real estate and he confirms that everything looks legit. Tarim asks that I meet the “superintendent” at the unit tomorrow to deliver application and cashiers check who will then take it from there. 

I arrive the next day and I meet Lisa (not her real name, the plot thickens here) at the unit. She’d already unlocked it and was waiting for me. She confirms with me that she works with Angel/Sun Realty and asks if I have anything ready. I hand over the documents to her and I’m told as soon as the office confirms receipt of the documents that I’ll receive my key to move in on the 22nd. 

Going to speed up now because I’m not sure what the character limit is on here. Oct 22 rolls around and Tarim emails me to meet Lisa at 3pm to get my door key and mail key. I show up at 2:50. By 3:20 I’m starting to sweat a little bit because no one is here and I tried Angels number but it’s disconnected. The pit is now forming in my stomach. I happen to see a neighbor walk by and I ask him for the property managers number. I call it. “Definitely Not Sun Realty Property Management, how can I help you?”. My heart sank. 

Turns out “my” unit was legitimately rented to some other lucky girl and that I’ve been rinsed. I’m on my way to the police station when “Lisa” calls me. The number she had for Angel doesn’t work anymore and he hasn’t paid her for her two weeks of work. Turns out she was brand new to this superintendent gig!

She actually meets me at the police station halfway through giving my report to provide evidence from her end. She responded to classified ad for this gentlemen from SF to be his LA area property supervisor and my unit was the first she’d be managing. Her job acceptance letter that she showed me was the exact same format, logo, header, etc as my application acceptance letter. She was instructed to send the check/application to a Georgia PO Box which she provided the police with. 

She then tells me and the police officer that she ran the same process with a different person at a different unit in Hollywood. Same lockbox. Same code. Same scam. This guy even received his key! I do a little digging and it turns out that the legitimate company manages both of these properties and the applications are almost identical outside of the name tweak. 

Anyway there’s now 3 open police reports. I’m in the hole about 2500 bucks and feel like a moron. Going to be talking with the legitimate company tomorrow because I think there’s a good chance it might be someone who worked or previously worked in their organization. I don’t know how they’d get the lockbox combos and know the time windows when people wouldn’t be in the unit. 

Thanks for listening, be careful out there.",LosAngeles,Scammed on an apartment,133

You can still root, root, root for the *Dodgers* with this quick guide to help you understand why it's such a big deal to people in this city. You'll see words in that you will probably hear a lot over the next week to hopefully help you understand the game a little bit better. *Still confused? Have a question? Ask away in the comments! All serious questions will get serious, nonjudgmental answers.*

**Major League Baseball (MLB)** is split into two leagues- **the National League (NL)** and the **American League (AL)**. These 2 leagues are then split into 3 divisions: West, Central, and East. Teams will **mostly** play only other teams in the same league, and will most often play teams in the same division.

This year, the Los Angeles Dodgers had the most wins in the NL West. That guaranteed them a playoff spot in the National League Division Series (think of it as the ""top 4""). The Dodgers beat the Atlanta Braves (by being the first to win 3 games out of 5) and won their NLDS. The Dodgers then played in the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers. This series went to 7 full games- both teams had won 3 out of the first 6- and the Dodgers managed to win Game 7 while in Milwaukee. This is the second year in a row the Dodgers managed to **""win the pennant""** by being National League Champions.

Now, the National League Champions (the Los Angeles Dodgers) will face the American League Champions (the Boston Red Sox) in the **World Series**, also called **""the fall classic.""** The World Series is a **""Best of 7""** series, meaning the first team to win 4 games will be the World Series Champions. They will not play any more games once a team has 4 wins. This is the schedule:

* Game 1: Tuesday, 10/23 in Boston, 5:09 PST
* Game 2: Wednesday, 10/24 in Boston, 5:09 PST
* Game 3: Friday, 10/26 in Los Angeles, 5:09 PST
* Game 4: Saturday, 10/27 in Los Angeles, 5:09 PST
* Game 5: Sunday, 10/28 in Los Angeles, 5:15pm PST (if necessary)
*Game 6: Tuesday, 10/30 in Boston, 5:09pm PST (if necessary)
*Game 7: Wednesday, 10/31 🎃 in Boston, 5:09pm PST (if necessary)

#STAY AWAY FROM DODGER STADIUM THIS FRIDAY, SATURDAY, AND POSSIBLY SUNDAY, FROM 2PM TO 10PM.

There is going to be insane traffic on the 101, 110, 2, and 5 Freeways, as well as **all** surface streets in Elysian and Echo Park this weekend.

Additionally, all sports bars will be featuring **all** World Series games and they will be **packed**. Dodger fans are diehard. Most games last around 3 hours, but it can potentially go much longer if the score is tied. This will be compounded with the fact that it's also
Halloween weekend for a lot of people. Have fun but stay safe!

Some quick info:

* The star starting pitcher (the ""ace"") is **Clayton Kershaw.**

* The star closing pitcher (the ""closer"") is **Kenley Jansen.**

* There are also 10(!) other pitchers on the active roster.

* Yasiel Puig is greeted with ""Puuuuuuuuuuiiig"" when he bats which sounds just like booing.

* You can easily make friends with Dodger fans by saying ""Fuck the Giants.""

Bonus facts:

* The Red Sox play at Fenway Park in Boston, which has a giant green wall nicknamed ""The Green Monster.""

* The last time the Red Sox and the Dodgers played against each other in the World Series was 1916. The Dodgers were then officially known as the Brooklyn Robins.

*In the American League, a pitcher usually does not bat, but has a Designated Hitter bet for them instead.",LosAngeles,"A guide: The Dodgers, the World Series, and you.",48

I got a minor traffic ticket earlier this year while working in California (forgot to put the new registration sticker on my car). I moved out of state in that time so I couldn’t go back to show it was fixed. I received a letter from the LA Superior Court stating that I needed to pay the ticket (my bad...). Due to my out of state drivers license, I couldn’t pay by phone for some reason. So I mailed a check in September, when I got the letter. The letter gets to the LA superior court and I see the $222 deducted from my bank account on 10/5. I assume it’s settled.

On 10/17, a letter is issued by a collections agency called GC collections services and sent to my home address. They say the debt has increased to $372 and my license is still suspended due to failure to pay the ticket. They say that the LA Superior Court has sent my ticket to collections, which is this agency. But how can they send my ticket to collections when I have proof in my bank account that they cashed the check? Why would they cash the check on the 5th, then send my debt to collections three weeks later? If my ticket didn’t go to my unpaid balance, where did it go?

I’ve tried calling the phone number for the LA Superior Court but it’s just an endless robot loop that doesn’t get me to a real person.

I’m unemployed and very poor right now, so I’m trying to figure out what I can do here, and if it’s a scam or something. I can’t afford to pay this ticket but I also can’t pay for an attorney. I’m afraid to even drive.

Thank you in advance! ",LosAngeles,"I paid a ticket to the LA Superior Court earlier this month. This week, I got a ticket from GC Collection Services saying my debt has increased even though I paid my ticket? Is this a scam?",25

Hi guys,

From a few heated discussions I've had with my libertarian/conservative friends on FB regarding the gas tax, SB-1, RRAA and proposition 6 (which will repeal all that), I've come to realize there's a lot of missing info the public doesn't seem to be aware of.

The biggest/most common missing info? Proposition 69.
This voter initiative passed by a landslide this past June and guarantees that all funds raised by SB-1 (also known as RRAA) go to transportation-related purposes ONLY.

---

Additionally, there's a lot of good stuff in SB-1/RRAA most of you probably don't know about. Specifically, oversight:

RRAA establishes the Office of the Transportation Inspector General who has authority over CalTrans and the ability to conduct audits/investigations. RRAA also expands the authority of the California Transportation Committee to set performance measures for project delivery to ensure work is completed at a reasonable pace.

---

Keep in mind that if Prop 6 passes, there's no guarantee that oil/gas companies will lower their prices. Wouldn't you rather have that money go towards roads and infrastructure at least?

If you think we already spend too much money on infrastructure, know that California was in the top 5 of lowest spenders per driver in the country, approximately $269/driver. Various conservative/libertarian organizations claim we're in the top 10 of worst roads in the nation, but I'm a little skeptical on that claim.
[Source](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/economy/2018/08/13/infrastructure-spending-states-that-are-falling-apart/37270513/?fbclid=IwAR2L72EyxRBQROsKon7jHgGlt2fBJoIo6CYojtfIvc-vH5iF8hdMRWA6_mg)

""But wait,"" you exclaim, ""what about Measure M!?""
Measure M is an LA county only initiative. It does not provide funding for OC, San Bernadino, Ventura county, much less the rest of this great state.

---

So far, I've only been responding to conservative concerns, but don't think I've forgotten about the liberal views on this (tho most are in agreement):
We should be incentivizing electric vehicles or, at the very least, higher MPG vehicles. Currently, as it stands, Zero Emission Vehicles only pay $100/yr + $25-$175, depending on the value of the vehicle in registration and fees. This makes environmental options much more attractive and puts us in the right direction for combating climate change.

Another concern I find a lot seems to be the fact that the California Legislature can increase taxes at will. Keep in mind that this requires a 2/3rds supermajority and Josh Newman lost his recall fight over this; it won't be easy for them to do this again. Combine this with Prop 69's assurance that this money will go to roads, I find it pretty reckless to repeal all the added oversight/auditing and much needed progress in bringing this state's infrastructure up to par with the American Society of Civil Engineers' recommendations. If this ballot measure had called for voter approval for each gas tax increase WITHOUT repealing RRAA, I would've supported it.

But again, I'm biased so take all this as you will.

He keeps the building looking really good and is really good about repairs.
