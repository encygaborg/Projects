    "#### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "okay, so there isn't a clear real utility for the simple classification of post into a subreddit. For one, 100% of posts on reddit belong to a subreddit so a post would always have its subreddit attached to it.  It's just obviously not very impressive in utility.  At first glance, that is.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating a binary classifier can bring to light some other factors about whatever's being studied. Keeping in mind that the sample of information they're getting from is demographically biased so there are limitations in its generaliztion to many other applications. \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning about what keywords are most important to a city may give you an idea about the culture in the city, or what's important to the city. So many things could be discovered from this sort of exploration. Could also be used in market research analysis (yawn) by comparing one brand's subreddit with another's. Or, one show's fanbase vs another's. This binary classification model can also be modified to be applied to message filters like sorting out spam from emails\n",
    "\n",
    "Sociologists for example, would have a field day with this with all the types of thematic analyses they could apply."

    "#### Preamble\n",
    ">  Reddit is an online public content sharing platform that is organized into different categories known as subreddits. Subreddits are comprised of user-submitted posts that can be text, media, or both. Posts can be interacted with through user-prompted upvotes, downvotes, comments, and of course, views. This project will outline the creation of a subreddit classifier that predicts the subreddit a given post is from. Specifially, it's a binary classifier for the Toronto and Los Angeles subreddits. This model can then be expanded upon to explore what the most important characteristics are of this classifier.\n",
